<span className="block font-bold">What's the process for raising issues and requesting features in SUI?</span>

Please see [Raise issues and requests with SUI](https://siteminder.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SUI/pages/886999394/Raise+issues+and+requests+with+SUI) Confluence doc.

<span className="block font-bold">The design does not match with SUI components</span>

A Design System is the single source of truth that groups all the elements that will allow the teams to design, realize and develop a product.

UI component has well-defined rules, constraints, and principles, implemented in design and code. So, It is recommended the design should be aligned with SUI
components for a better experience and avoid any difference during the implantation process.

<span className="block font-bold">Skinning of SUI is doable as of now, yes?</span>

Yes, this can be done currently. There are three methods of achieving this:

- CSS overrides the base components
- Certain components can be [white-labelled](/docs/guides-white-labelling--page)
- Certain components can be [themed](/docs/guides-theming--overview)
