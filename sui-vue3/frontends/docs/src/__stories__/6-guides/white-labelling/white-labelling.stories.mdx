White labelling, in SiteMinder's case specifically, is used to allow aesthetic edits to the navigation components only. This is available to our partner customers.

Our partner customers have the ability to:
- edit their app headers to include their own custom logo, in place of the SiteMinder logo
- edit the 6 colour variables used in the app header - this gives allows our partners to have a sense of their own branding when managing their properties channels.

## Nexus colour mapping

Nexus currently offers 6 colour variables to customise our app-header. In order to transfer customers across from Channel Manager to Property Platform we are required to keep like-for-like functionality which includes white-labelling of the header. Therefore these 6 variables needs to be translated to the SUI header format.

In order to do this we have grouped existing SUI white-labelling variables and mapped them to corresponding Nexus variables.

This provides like-for-like functionality but not like-for-like implementation. Some colours still need to be updated to make the SUI header functional and accessible. We hope to improve this in the future.

## What gets branded?

Colours are configurable via this guide, but content and imagery should be
passed where relevant. For example, the `sm-app-header` component accepts a
logo property, which should be implemented in your application's logic. Consult
the team for requirements and acceptance criteria when branding your
application.


## How to

### Step 1: Install the SUI white-labelling.css

**Deprecated: `sui-core@15.0.0-vue3`**

Proceed to step two.

The `white-labelling.css` file is no longer exported by the library.
The white-labelling tokens are already mapped inside the relevant component files.

**For `sui-core@14.X.X-vue3` and earlier:**

Add the following to your project's `main.ts` (or a similar entry-level file):

```ts dark
import '@siteminder/sui-core/white-labelling/white-labelling.css'
```

### Step 2: Define your CSS variables

The white-labelling solution leverages global [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties)
to style certain components, such as the app-header. Where your application
sources those colours is not part of the SUI white-labelling solution.

Note: CSS Variables may not be supported by your application's browser support
matrix. In fact, as of today, almost all SiteMinder applications should apply
a polyfill, such as the `css-vars-ponyfill`.

Add the list following variables to your project's css files or inside `style` tag.


## Design alignment

After version `sui-core@0.107.0` (Vue2), we had to make some modification to
the SUI white-labelling variables to align `Nexus/SPUTNIK` white-labelling variables.

Please find the [SUI and Nexus variable mapping document](https://siteminder.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SUI/pages/2154760320/SUI+header+and+Nexus+variable+mapping)
and an agreement on the phases release.

### Released: Phase 1
