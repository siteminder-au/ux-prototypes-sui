## Accessibility, Usability and Inclusion

All SiteMinder products should strive to be accessible and usable for everyone. SUI aims to meet AA accessibility at a minimum, following the WCAG guidelines, but goes further than that. Our aim is to build an accessible system that holds usability in the highest regard - usability for all users regardless of access needs.

> **1 in 5 people in Australia have a disability.** That's 20% of Australians. Of those 20% of Australians, the online experience of 18.5% are affected by inaccessible design. This is Australia's largest minority group, so let's not ignore them.

> **Total spending power** of families with at least one disabled person is estimated at $54 million a year.

> People aged **65 and over develop age related impairments**. We have an ageing population, staying in the workforce longer.

  Your product can meet WCAG guidelines but still be unusable. Accessibility is a requirement but usability is far more important.
  We must strive to design and build satisfying user experiences for everyone - WCAG is only the mandatory stuff.
