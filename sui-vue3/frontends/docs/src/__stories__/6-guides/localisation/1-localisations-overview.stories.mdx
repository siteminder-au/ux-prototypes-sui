## Definitions

### What is Localisation?
Localisation refers to adapting your product to different locales and ensuring the patterns and designs used are appropriate in terms of culture and language.

<div className="sui-storybook-highlight">
  Localisation is sometimes written in English as l10n, where 10 is the number of letters in the English word between l and n.
</div>

**Localisation can entail customisation related to:**
1. Numeric, date and time formats
2. Use of currency
3. Keyboard usage
4. Collation and sorting
5. Symbols, icons and colours
6. Text and graphics containing references to objects, actions or ideas which, in a given culture, may be subject to misinterpretation or viewed as insensitive.
7. Varying legal requirements
8. and many more things.

### What is Internationalisation?
Internationalisation refers to the general way you build your product for different locales, i.e. including flexible interfaces that allow for text expansion and changes to word order or even alignment. Internationalisation enables easy localisation for users that vary in region, culture and language.

<div className="sui-storybook-highlight">
  Internationalisation is often written in English as i18n, where 18 is the number of letters between i and n in the English word.
</div>

**Internationalisation covers:**
1. Designing and developing in a way that removes barriers to localisation or international deployment. This includes such things as enabling the use of Unicode, or ensuring the proper handling of legacy character encodings where appropriate, taking care over the concatenation of strings, avoiding dependance in code of user-interface string values, etc.
2. Providing support for features that may not be used until localisation occurs. For example, adding markup in your DTD to support bidirectional text, or for identifying language. Or adding to CSS support for vertical text or other non-Latin typographic features.
3. Enabling code to support local, regional, language, or culturally related preferences. Typically this involves incorporating predefined localisation data and features derived from existing libraries or user preferences. Examples include date and time formats, local calendars, number formats and numeral systems, sorting and presentation of lists, handling of personal names and forms of address, etc.
4. Separating localisable elements from source code or content, such that localised alternatives can be loaded or selected based on the user's international preferences as needed.


## What languages and locales do we support?
Our current font-family is Google Noto which supports an exhaustive amount of languages. The following is the current list of languages that we support in SUI:

- English (en)
- German (de)
- Spanish (es)
- French (fr)
- Indonesian (id)
- Italian (it)
- Thai (th)
- Portuguese (pt)

Find out more about [Google Noto](https://fonts.google.com/noto).

If you need another language supported, please request this with the SUI team.


## How much of localisation and internationalisation is handled by SUI?

**One common misconception is that SUI handles full component localisation, which is not the case.**

When it comes to localisation, SUI controls everything built into the component. For example, in the wizard, we control the translations for the Back and Next buttons, however all the content that goes into the main container of the wizard is not something we can control, and **the product teams must ensure everything has properly been localised**.

As an example, please see the diagram below. Everything in pink is localised by SUI and everything in blue is localised by the product teams.

**A couple of rules of thumb we follow when handling localisation:**
- Sentence case only - no title case
- No use of ampersands (&)
- No use of acronyms by themselves. always write words in full
- No use of abbreviation wherever possible, always write words in full
- E-mail hyphenated
- No use of tech jargon - simple and generic wording at all times
- Bolded words to give emphasis - no italic nor underlined words
- Double quotation marks - not single quotation marks
