## Time formatting in sm-date-picker
Currently the only component that allows a user to pick time is our `sm-date-picker` component, using the time or date and time variants and `sm-time-picker`.

- `sm-date-picker `only supports 12-hour time formatting. **Current best practise is to use 24-hour time as this is the most widely used format globally, and we hope to add that option to our date picker soon.**
- `sm-time-picker` is similar to sm-select and supports 24-hour time from the dropdown.
