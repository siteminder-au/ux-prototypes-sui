## Natural Movement
Motion should always strive for realism and credibility. Our users have a lifetime of experience interacting with the physical world, leveraging this innate understanding can be the difference between effective animations and motion that is jarring or uncomfortable.

## Personality forward
Motion adds life to our interface by reinforcing feelings of accomplishment and delight, while assisting users with focus and guidance.
It elicits an emotional response from our users by highlighting key moments in their journeys, incorporating personality into common interactions.

## Help - not hinder
Motion can provide delight, clarity, give feedback and guidance to a user. It can be a powerful tool in solving problems.

It should, however, never be an obstacle the user needs to overcome or a barrier to actioning their needs.

## Diverse and inclusive
Our motion design acknowledges diversity and difference. It provides a comparable experience by considering different perspectives and approaches so that people can complete tasks in a way that meets their needs without compromising the quality of our content.

Our motion provides users an inclusive experience while being culturally and emotionally sensitive.
