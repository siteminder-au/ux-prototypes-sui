## Goals and principles

We write and create content in order to educate, guide, and empower our users. Product content is important for achieving better customer knowledge in our products' use. As a SaaS firm,  we use a 'digital first' approach to content and customer interactions.

### Inform
We provide accurate, useful information so users have everything they need to successfully utilise our products.

### Guide
We give simple, straightforward steps to complete any and all tasks. The time savings made by users is key to the success of our products. We employ any necessary combination of media and copy to effectively communicate and guide users.

### Empower
Help readers and users get the most out of our offerings. Utilising the full functionality of our products empowers users to save more time and drive revenue. This makes our products not only useful but indispensable to our customers' businesses.

### Engage
Encourage users to come to us for knowledge. Product content is an essential vehicle for developing and maintaining customer relationships. As these interactions take place online we take a 'digital first' approach to building trust and expertise.



## Voice

All SiteMinder products should strive to be accessible and usable for everyone. SUI aims to meet AA accessibility at a minimum, following the WCAG guidelines, but goes further than that. Our aim is to build an accessible system that holds usability in the highest regard - usability for all users regardless of access needs.

### Approachable
Global, natural, and polite. We're available and ready to answer questions and find solutions to our customers' problems.

### Knowledgeable
Professional, accurate, and succinct. We are industry leaders keen to share information that benefits our customers and their guests.

### Helpful
Clear and informative. Like the hotel front desk who welcomes you, processes your reservation, and can answer any questions about your stay.



## Tone

The purpose of communications informs the tone we should use. UI content should be written in a tone and voice that is consistent with the organisation's brand and values.

Notifications should be matter-of-fact, with errors and warnings being treated more formally. A call-to-action to activate a product or feature benefits from a more enthusiastic tone.

## Language, styles and grammar

### Basics

#### Capitalisation
Use sentence casing where possible, only capitalising the start of a sentence and proper nouns or names.
<img src={cap} alt="Always use sentence case formatting" width="780"/>

#### Spelling
UK/AU English is our main content language. Refer to the Oxford Dictionary or the Macquarie Dictionary if in doubt.
<img src={spelling} alt="Use British English"  width="780"/>

#### Style
Write actively, keeping sentences succinct. At SiteMinder, we employ an active voice. It not only helps to simplify phrases, but it may also help you shorten and simplify your writing. Keep a global audience in mind and avoid jargon, puns, or inappropriate humour.
<img src={style1} alt="'Easily scan your transactions' over 'Your transactions can be easily scanned'"  width="780"/>

Active voice might come across as harsh at times. Use the passive voice in these situations. This gives the actor enough distance from the action to soften a sentence.
<img src={style2} alt="'Your payment has been declined over 'We declined your payment'"  width="780"/>

### Grammar

#### Abbreviations
Always write the word out on the first mention, introducing the abbreviation in brackets. Capitalise each word in a proper noun such as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), otherwise only capitalise a term if it begins a sentence.
<img src={abb} alt="First mention is 'Two-factor authentication' and subsequent mentions is '(2FA)'"  width="780"/>

Example:

#### Common abbreviations:

<ul>
 <li>GDPR - General Data Protection Regulation </li>
 <li>promo code - Promotion/promotional code </li>
 <li>PMS - Property management system</li>
 <li>RMS - Revenue management system </li>
 <li>CRS - Central reservations system </li>
  <li>SEO - Search engine optimisation </li>
</ul>

#### Non-English names
Use the original noun when there isn't an accepted English equivalent and provide an explanation of the term.
<img src={nonenglish} alt="Use non english nouns is fine, such as 'Kassensicherungsverordnung'"  width="780"/>

Example:

#### Ampersands
Avoid using ampersands (&), except if part of a brand name or where space is limited.

<img src={ampersands} alt="Spell the word 'and' instead of using an ampersand"  width="780"/>

<div className="sui-storybook-highlight sui-storybook-highlight--alert">
Using "and" instead of ampersand sign (&) is beneficial for localization purposes and users who may have lower literacy levels or cognitive impairments. Some screen readers can't detect the code behind an ampersand, which obscures the message for the user.
</div>

#### Bold Text
Utilise bold text to direct the reader's eye to essential words and statements in your email content. Use bold only to indicate UI elements (exact label), or for subheadings when appropriate.
<img src={bold} alt="Only bold vital words, not entire sentences"  width="780"/>

#### Colon
A colon can be used to: precede examples, lists, or questions, all written in lowercase. Only capitalise the word after a colon if it's a proper noun or acronym.
<img src={colon} alt="Dos and don'ts"  width="780"/>

#### Coma
When displaying items, use a serial comma (also known as the Oxford comma). This involves using a comma after the word "and" when listing multiple items in a sentence.
<img src={comma} alt="Dos and don'ts"  width="780"/>

#### Contractions
Use common contractions (it's, you're, they're) to give a copy a personal tone, but avoid when readability is negatively impacted. Avoid negative contractions such as can't, don't, shouldn't as it can increase the risk of misreading.
<img src={cont} alt="Dos and don'ts"  width="780"/>

#### Dashes and hyphens
Use a hyphen (en dash) for compound words and the long dash (em dash) for emphasis in a sentence. Em dashes can help prevent misunderstanding when the phrase being set apart includes multiple commas, such as a mid-sentence list. But, in general, try to make sentences as short and basic as possible to avoid overly confusing punctuation.

Spaces should be used on either side of an em dash. On a Mac, use option-shift-hyphen to create an em dash.

For numeric ranges and for lengths of time, use a hyphen with no spaces instead of an em or en dash.

<ul>
<li><strong>Currently used examples and exceptions:</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Email (email) </li>
<li>Check-in and check-out as nouns </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<img src={dash} alt="Examples for dashes being used incorrectly"  width="780"/>

#### Italics
Never use italics in any content. It creates major problems for certain language translations.
<img src={italics} alt="An example of italics being used in content incorrectly"  width="780"/>

#### Noun vs verb
Some nouns are created from phrasal verbs. Only remove the space between words for the noun form and retain them when describing an action.
<img src={noun} alt="Examples of nouns being used incorrectly"  width="780"/>

#### Quotation marks
Use single straight quotation marks to emphasise titles, UI elements, and terms that could cause confusion.

Use double quotation marks for direct quotes and provide attribution.
<img src={quote} alt="Examples of quotation marks being used incorrectly"  width="780"/>



## Content structure

Well structured content with cohesive formatting supports the reader (and search engines) as they search for information.

### Attribution
Always provide attribution when referencing another source of information. Use in-text links or footnotes.
<img src={attrib} alt="This example shows attribution with the reference name and link within the text" width="780"/>

### Headings
Use short, meaningful headings, adding keywords if appropriate. Organise headings in a logical order.

The structure is VERB + FEATURE. If multiple verbs are needed, then it's VERB, VERB, or VERB + FEATURE. If needed to clarify, the location can be added: VERB + FEATURE + TAB/PAGE.

#### Best practice

<ul>
<li>Max 70 characters </li>
<li>No questions if possible </li>
<li>Start with keyword if possible </li>
<li>Keep to max 4 levels </li>
<li>Use different font weights and sizes </li>
</ul>
<img src={head} alt="Dos and don'ts" width="780"/>

### Hyperlinks
Use natural linking in sentences where possible to minimise obstacles for readers.

Example:
<img src={hyper1} alt="Dos and don'ts"  width="780"/>

Otherwise, when using the full article title for a link, don't use a full stop at the end of the line.

Example:
<img src={hyper2} alt="Dos and don'ts" width="780" />

### Lists
Use bullets when the order is unimportant, and numbers when the order is critical.

Lists make scanning easier.
Lists should always have an introduction heading:
Don't use semicolons (;) behind each item
Only use full stops if the items are sentences.

### Paragraphs and sentences
Keep sentences and paragraphs short. Effective sentences average 15-20 words and only exceed 25 words when necessary. Start with the most important information, and write in an active voice.



## Formatting

Well structured content with cohesive formatting supports the reader (and search engines) as they search for information

### Currency

Use [ISO alphabetic codes for currency](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html#:~:text=The%20first%20two%20letters%20of,and%20the%20D%20for%20dollar.), use a single space between the code and number. In some languages the alphabetic code comes after the value, continue to use a space.

Countries use either a comma or full stop for decimals. Conventions by country can be found here
<img src={curr} alt="Dos and don'ts"  width="780"/>


### Dates

Dates are written out whenever space permits. Abbreviations are typically used in UI, tables, and systems. Use a full stop for every abbreviated month except May.

Some experiences might require the full format, where others might require something more compact:

<ul>
<li>Full: Wednesday, March 10 2022 at 3:07pm</li>
<li>Compact: Wed., Mar. 10 2022, 3:07pm</li>
</ul>

#### Abbreviations:

Jan., Feb., Mar., Apr., May, Jun., Jul., Aug., Sep., Oct., Nov., Dec.

#### Format:
<img src={dates} alt="Dos and don'ts" width="780"/>


### Numbers
Write down the words zero through nine in running sentences, then begin using the number for ten and higher, except at the start of a sentence. Avoid starting sentences with numbers wherever possible.

#### Exceptions:
<img src={numbers} alt="Dos and don'ts"  width="780"/>

<ul>
<li>Always use numerals next to a percentage symbol unless cohesion dictates otherwise.</li>
<li>When quoting verbatim values that the user enters into the UX or may find in the UX.Example: Enter '3' as the multiplier to...</li>
</ul>

### Times
Times are written in numerals using 24-hour format and a colon dividing hours and minutes.
<img src={time} alt="Dos and don'ts"  width="780"/>
