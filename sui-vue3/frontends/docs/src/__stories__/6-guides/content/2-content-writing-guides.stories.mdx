## Inputs and placeholders

We write and create content in order to educate, guide, and empower our users. Product content is important for achieving better customer knowledge in our products' use. As a SaaS firm,  we use a 'digital first' approach to content and customer interactions.

### Format
- **Label**: Field name
- **Placeholder**: A verb plus brief description
- **Description (optional)**: A noun followed by a description

For date placeholders, use the default for the following: UK/AU: DD / MM / YYYY

For time placeholders, default to: 00:00

<img src={input} alt="Here are some examples of how to add content to inputs"  width="780"/>

<div className="sui-storybook-highlight sui-storybook-highlight--alert">
Note: While placeholder text provides valuable guidance for many users, placeholder text is not a replacement for labels. Assistive technologies, such as screen readers, do not treat placeholder text as labels. Moreover, placeholder text is not broadly supported across assistive technologies and is not displayed in older web browsers.
</div>

## Empty states
An empty state notification displays when a task or workflow has been finished, or after all data linked with a certain functionality has been erased. For example, emptying an inbox. These messages are intended to congratulate, energise, and push people to go on to the next assignment.

### Best practices:

#### Title

- Add a headline that is both informative and scannable. Try to keep the amount of words as low as possible.
- Unless it's a question, write in sentence case and without punctuation.
- Use the title to explain the empty condition or to inform people about what they can do

#### Body copy

- Provide the explanation for the empty condition as well as possible future steps. If they have nothing to do, congratulate them on completing a task.
- Avoid duplicating information from the title.
- Limit communications to one or two sentences in length. Consider other people's time and patience. Avoid jargon and keep your sentences brief and to the point.

#### Call to action - CTA

- When proposing an action to execute after an empty state, use imperative verbs like "Try", "Delete", or "Create" in the CTA to specify what action consumers will take rather than ambiguous phrases like "OK".
- Keep your call to action to one or two words.
- The title of the empty state should always be complemented by your CTA button.
- Keep an eye on how many call to action buttons there are on a single page. You don't want to overwhelm your users.

## Error messages

An error message, as opposed to a warning message, displays after a user has performed an action. The messaging emphasises on what has occurred, the effects, and what users must do to proceed. They can also describe why something happened and why the problem occurred.

While creating an error message, keep in mind that most users skim text rather than reading it all, be concise. Keep the error message short and to the point.

<img src={error1} alt="The anatomy of an error message"  width="644"/>

### Best practices

#### Title (optional) (what happened)

- Titles are optional, depending on the component.
- Use a headline that is both informative and scannable
- Avoid discussing what users should do.
- Write in sentence case, using proper punctuation.
- Use plain language, and avoid jargon

#### Body copy (underlying cause)

- Provide the following information: the cause of the error and the problem, how someone should respond, and what occurs if they do not act.
- If you don't know why an issue occurred, don't invent one; simply state that something went wrong and suggest a fix for what people can do.
- Avoid duplicating information from the title.
- Limit communications to one or two sentences.
- Avoid including technical details in the message.
- Use plain language, and avoid jargon.

#### Call to action - CTA (optional)  (How to fix it)

- When an error message prompts an option, instead of using nonspecific phrases like "OK," use strong verbs like "Save," "Delete," or "Create" in the CTA to explain what action consumers will take.
- A reject or cancel option informs individuals that they may opt out.
- Keep your CTA to one or two words.

More error message details can be found on the [content confluence page](https://siteminder.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CONTENT/pages/2370699628/Content+UX+writing+guide#Callouts-within-UX-copy).

#### Be empathetic to users rather than the system:

As a general guideline, avoid displaying the error until the user has completed the form and moved on to the next.
Do not blame the user even if the error is on their side.
Only include error codes if they are meaningful and relevant.

## Warning messages
A warning message, which is different from an error message, is displayed before taking any action that indicates a serious change or potential data loss. Warn users about potential problems that may or may not require action on their part.

While creating a warning message, keep in mind that most users skim text rather than reading it all, be concise. Keep the error message short and to the point.

### Best practices:

#### Title

- Titles are optional, depending on the component.
- Use a headline that is both informative and scannable
- Avoid discussing what users should do.
- Write in sentence case, using proper punctuation.
- Use plain language, and avoid jargon

#### Body copy

- Provide the following information: Explain the cause of the warning, the possible issue, the recommended course of action, and the consequences of the action or inaction.

#### Call to action - CTA

- When a warning message prompts an option, instead of using nonspecific phrases like "OK," use strong verbs like "Save," "Delete," or "Create" in the CTA to explain what action consumers will take.
- A reject or cancel option informs individuals that they may opt out.
- Keep your CTA to one or two words.

<img src={warning} alt="Examples of different warning types"  width="780"/>



## Success messages

Once someone has done an action or finished a task, a success message shows. The message provides a chance to affirm or commend them on their activity.

While creating a success message, keep in mind that most users skim text rather than reading it all. Be concise. Keep the error message short and to the point.

### Best practices:

#### Title

- Titles are optional, depending on the component.
- Use a headline that is both informative and scannable
- Avoid discussing what users should do.
- Write in sentence case, using proper punctuation.
- Use plain language, and avoid jargon
- Avoid using exclamations! We don't want to be overly enthusiastic about everything!

#### Body copy

- Specify the cause of the success – confirm what action was done or what task was performed. Let people view their work if they have developed it.
- Limit communications to one or two sentences. Offer a few words of encouragement followed by one or two phrases of insightful information.

#### Call to action (CTA) (optional)

- Unless there are any follow-up choices, CTAs are frequently optional. Provide a CTA only when necessary.
- When a warning message prompts an option, instead of using nonspecific phrases like "OK," use strong verbs like "Save," "Delete," or "Create" in the CTA to explain what action consumers will take.
- Give users the choice to ignore the message at all times. (close options)
- Keep your CTA to one or two words.

## Action labels
To determine how to interact with an interface, users rely on consistent labelling for common actions.

### Add
Takes an existing element, and uses it to create a new item (e.g, adding a new user, adding a new date range, etc.)
<img src={add} alt="Combine 'Add' with the item in context, for example, Add user or Add room type"  width="780"/>

### Assign
Connects a certain object to a particular item.
<img src={assign} alt="Best practice"  width="780"/>

### Back
Takes the user back to the first step in a series of stages, like in a wizard. Use in place of previous.
<img src={back} alt="Best practice"  width="780"/>

### Cancel
Stops the current action and closes the dialog.
<img src={cancel} alt="Best practice"  width="780"/>

### Clear / Clear all
This action removes all selected fields or choices. For controls that always have a selection or value, such as radio buttons, the default selection or value is often re-established when cleared is performed.
<img src={clear} alt="Best practice"  width="780"/>

### Create
Generates a new item from scratch (for example, creating their first room type or creating a new promotion code).
<img src={create} alt="Best practice"  width="780"/>

### Delete
Removes an existing object to render it inactive (for example, deletes a room type or deletes a value from a table cell).
<img src={deletion} alt="Where appropriate, combine Delete with the item as necessary (for example, Delete direct booking rate)"  width="780"/>

### Learn more
Additional, highly relevant information is shown. If more information is present but does not make sense in the immediate context, insert it towards the end of inline text.
<img src={learn} alt="If there is room, provide relevant language that summarises the topic you are linking to beside Learn more)"  width="780"/>

### Next
Takes the user to the following stage in a series of steps, like in a wizard.
<img src={next} alt="Best practice" width="780" />

### Save
Saves any current changes to a file or item. The window or panel is automatically closed and a toast shows to indicate successful saving.
<img src={save} alt="Best practice"  width="780"/>

### Select all
Checks every checkbox or adds every object in the display to the selection set.
<img src={select} alt="Best practice" width="780" />
