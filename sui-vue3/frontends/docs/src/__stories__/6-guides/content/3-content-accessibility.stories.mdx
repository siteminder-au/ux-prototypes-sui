## Accessibility text

<div className="sui-storybook-highlight sui-storybook-highlight--alert">
Design and content accessibility lets people of varying abilities browse, comprehend, and utilise your Interface.
</div>

Text used by screen reader accessibility software, such as Google TalkBack on Android, Apple VoiceOver on iOS, and Freedom Scientific's JAWS on desktop, is referred to as accessible text. Screen readers read aloud the text and components (such as buttons) on the screen, including both visible and non-visible alternative text.

Accessibility text covers both visible text (such as UI element labels, buttons, links, and form text) and non-visible explanations that do not display on screen (such as alternative text for images).

When both visible and non-visible content on a screen is descriptive and useful, it aids users in navigating via headers or links. A screen reader can assist you in testing accessibility text and identifying areas where it can be added.



## Alternative text

Alt text aids in the conversion of a visual UI to a text-based UI.

Alt text is a brief (up to 125 character) descriptor in the code that explains an image for viewers who cannot see it.

There is no need to include "image of" or "picture of" in the alt text because the alt text is solely for images.

Keep in mind that the images will not be visible to everyone who visits your website. Some maybe visually impaired users and may utilise assistive technology such as screen readers or text-to-speech software to analyse web pages for them.

Alt text is also useful for sighted people since it appears if an image fails to load. Add relevant keywords to assist the user in learning more about the image.

<img src={alttext} alt="Good alt text for an image might be: The North Seoul Tower and skyline at night" width="780" />



## Reading speed

Every UI element is spoken audibly to screen reader users. The shorter the text, the faster it can be navigated by a screen reader user.



## Accessible content

Consider your page and content structure. Traditionally, screen readers read from left to right and top to bottom. Make sure you arrange your page's content with this in mind. When it comes to tables, keep them basic and make sure that each column has a clear heading.

### Headings
Headings and subheadings are important for accessibility.

Headline levels are important, particularly for screen reader users and search engines. It means one unique first level heading every page, with the other headings indicating the page content in a way comparable to a book's index: readily scannable and meaningful.

Why headings and landmarks are so important

#### Best practices:
Use one distinct h1 for each page to explain the content of that page. The h1 should ideally begin right above the main material.

- Use headers to describe the following content.
- Utilise heading levels in the same way a book's index is organised: hierarchically.
- Choose a heading based on its level in the context of the content rather than its size.
- Do not skip a level of heading from the top down.

#### WCAG on headings
- **Success Criterion: 2.4.6:** [Headings and labels](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#headings-and-labels): Offer methods for people to browse and locate content. Topics and purposes are described using headings and labels.
- **Success Criterion: 3.2.3:** [Consistent Navigation Level](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=246#consistent-navigation): Navigational mechanisms that are repeated on multiple Web pages within a set of Web pages occur in the same relative order each time they are repeated, unless a change is initiated by the user.
- **Success Criterion: 1.3.1:** [Information and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=246#info-and-relationships): Information, structure, and relationships given via presentation can be calculated automatically or are available in text. In other words, if it appears to be a heading, it should be one in the HTML (and not for example text made bold).

<div className="sui-storybook-highlight sui-storybook-highlight--alert">
Use headers to describe information in a consistent and semantic manner. This will help all users discover the stuff they are seeking for more easily.
</div>



## Best practices

### Make content perceivable
Screen readers should be considered while creating content. Some of our users are unable to see. When they use the internet, they utilise screen readers. Someone can instruct a screen reader to just read headers (H1, H2, and so on), to jump from section to section, or to only scan links.

### Make content operable
- Check that field labels are visible and persistent when the focus is inside the field.
Labels, tooltips, and input fields should be ordered logically by keyboarding tab.
- Be mindful of when and when the system verifies the fields, as well as when and where error notifications may occur.
- Display faults clearly. Employ an element other than colour to direct readers to the field that requires their attention.

### Make content understandable
#### 1. Readable
Some users have cognitive or learning problems. To assist concentrate their attention, these people want material that is straightforward, clear, and direct. Avoid figures of speech, idioms, and convoluted metaphors by using simple language.

[3.1.5 READING LEVEL](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/meaning-supplements.html): Write content at an 8th grade reading level.

#### 2. Information hierarchy and layout
Check that the proper HTML (H1, H2, etc.) is utilised so that screen readers may readily interact with the page       structure. (Search engines utilise this to examine your content as well.)

To make information easier to skim, use headings, subheadings, and bullet points.

### Make content robust
Check that everything works properly across platforms, browsers, and devices—different assistive technologies perform better in certain areas than others.

Try to be platform agnostic.
