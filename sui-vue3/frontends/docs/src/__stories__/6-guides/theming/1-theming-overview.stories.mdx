## About

A theme can be thought of as a set of variables or 'global tokens' that are applied globally to your components.
Containing all of the colors, spacing units, and typography rules. Together they define how your components look
and feel (not their behavior). Allowing you to provide tailored and accessible experiences.

Theming system can be broken down into <a href="https://siteminder.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SUI/pages/2283569463/Theming+-+Guidelines#Multi-tiered-variable-system" target="_blank"><strong>multi-tiered variable system</strong></a>.

## Design tokens

Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system — specifically,
they are named entities that store visual design attributes. We use them in
place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for
spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI
development.

For a design system powering multiple brands, each brand should define its own
design tokens, which then hook into the design system's codebase.
There are several token categories:

* [Color](/docs/guides-theming--design-tokens#color)
* [Typography](/docs/guides-theming--design-tokens#typography)
* [Spacing](/docs/guides-theming--design-tokens#spacing)
* [Global](/docs/guides-theming--design-tokens#global)


## Styling hooks

Styling hooks use CSS custom properties which make it easy to customize
component styling and express your brand, especially when working
with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components" target="_blank">web components and shadow DOM</a>.

Styling hooks will enable customization for your components. Styling hooks are
constructed using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties" target="_blank">CSS custom properties</a>
(also referred to as CSS variables or cascading variables)


* [Theme categories](/docs/guides-theming--styling-hooks#theme-categories)
* [Naming conventions](/docs/guides-theming--styling-hooks#naming-conventions)

## Setup

The design system supports the ability to "theme" its colors, typography, and
spacing. This is accomplished by overriding the default Sass variables.

* [How to override](/docs/guides-theming--setup#override)
* [Installation](/docs/guides-theming--setup#installation)
