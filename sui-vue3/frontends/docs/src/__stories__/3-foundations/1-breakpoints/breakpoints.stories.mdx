<hr/>

SUI covers 6 breakpoints, and they are as follows:

- $viewport--small-mobile: 320px; _(not currently used by our app)_
- $viewport--mobile: 640px; _(not currently used by our app)_
- $viewport--tablet: 768px;
- $viewport--small-desktop: 1024px;
- $viewport--large-desktop: 1366px;
- $viewport--extra-large-desktop: 1367px; _(to infinity)_

However, for designers, using the 1366 breakpoint in Figma should suffice for most of your layouts. Testing everything in tablet (768) will also be necessary to ensure all your components and page layouts are not breaking for those accessing the site on different devices.


## Breakpoints in Figma

## Devices

### Extra large desktop

The example shown below is resolution of 1920x1080. As you can see we have a max width of **1140px** as well as spacing within that container of `padding: 48px 56px`.
When you subtract the padding, with the width set to 100% of the container, the content space ends up measuring **1028px**.

<span className="sui-storybook-image-caption">Extra large desktop</span>

### Large desktop

1366 is what most you should be designing your pages in for desktop, you can find a template [here](https://www.figma.com/file/cTcXdzx0DtNU2Pm8kkm7wL/?node-id=9119%3A215294).

Our top 3 screen resolutions used by our users are:

- 1280 x 960
- 1920 x 1080
- 1366 x 768

Below you will find the an example of what our app looks like on a resolution of 1366x768. It has a max-width of **1040px** as well as spacing within that container of `padding: 48px 32px`.
When you subtract the padding, with the width set to 100% of the container, the content space ends up measuring **976px**.

### Small desktop (Large tablet) // Tablet // Small tablet

The tablet header will activate from **1024px**. It has a max-width of **1040px** as well as spacing within that container of `padding: 48px 32px`.

### Mobile

<div className="sui-storybook-highlight sui-storybook-highlight--alert">
  At this stage, SiteMinder products are not being built to be optimised on mobile, this is something we aim to change in the future.
  However SUI is a responsive design system and we should be in a good place once we enable the mobile breakpoint fully.
</div>

While the official mobile breakpoint is 360, please ensure you are testing your designs on 320 wide (iPhone SE/5) to ensure the page is looking good for all users regardless of device. This breakpoint will feature the tablet/mobile header (no vertical-nav).

The properties of sm-container at this breakpoint are exactly the same as all the tablet breakpoints.
