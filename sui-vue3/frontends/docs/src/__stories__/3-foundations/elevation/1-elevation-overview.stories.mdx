## Elevation Styles
Elevation styles are used to distinguish between surfaces. There are four elevation styles available in a variety of depths.

In some cases, such as the collapse button on the side navigation component, a lower level tier will be needed because the object is so small.
**Shadow-lg** and **Shadow-xl** are only appropriate for larger containers like modals.

## Usage

Some elevation styles are used on specific components within the SUI design system




<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Elevation</th>
      <th>Component</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>shadow-sm</td>
      <td>Toast</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>shadow-md</td>
      <td>Date Picker<br/>Dropdown</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>shadow-lg</td>
      <td>Cards - hover state</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>shadow-xl</td>
      <td>Dialog<br/>Wizard</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Default
The lowest level, visible container.

<img src={defaultElevation} alt="Default elevation" width="846" />

### shadow-sm
Minor elevation, used on very small options only.

<img src={small} alt="Default elevation" width="672" />

### shadow-md
Also used for small to medium interactive interface elements.  Applied to actionable components to make it obvious that you can click on the element.

<img src={medium} alt="Medium elevation" width="504" />

### shadow-lg
For medium to large components designed to disrupt a user's workflow or draw their attention Used after interacting with actionable components but not taking action (such as hover interactions and focus states)

<img src={large} alt="Large elevation" width="672" />

### shadow-xl
Used for medium to large UI components designed to disrupt a user's workflow or draw their attention.

<img src={extraLarge} alt="Extra large elevation" width="846" />


## Changing elevation
In some cases, components can change elevation in response to user interaction. When this happens, components move to elevation offsets, which are the
elevations components move to when they are not in the default state.

**Dynamic elevations** are the same across each type of the component. For example, all table cell headers use the same elevation when the table row/column
headers becomes fixed or when subheaders or footers become sticky and the content starts scrolling behind. Once the user reverts back to the original view,
the component swiftly returns to its **resting elevation which is the default** (no shadow).

<img src={changing} alt="Changing elevation" width="846" />

For table headers use the following shadow styles in our library:

<img src={table} alt="Table elevation" width="846" />


## Elevation Hierarchy
Elevations represent different levels of importance depending on the component.

Components that are in front of another component typically:
- Include more important information
- A dialog, for example, can draw attention.
- Control the surfaces below it, such as app bar functions.

<img src={hierarchy} alt="Elevation hierarchy" width="846" />

Surfaces that lack elevation can appear coplanar two-dimensional.  You can communicate hierarchy distinctions through their content and by modifying their
horizontal and vertical layout positions to represent their respective hierarchy levels for surfaces that do not express elevation.


## Guidelines
For small components or in dense areas, **avoid using excessively large shadows**. These shadows are reserved for more specialized uses, such as a Modal or Wizard.

<img src={guides1} alt="Guideline 1" width="846" />

Don't combine shadows on similar components.

<img src={guides2} alt="Guideline 2" width="846" />

Use of too many shadows will result in a confusing hierarchy.
