## Logo Color

The logo comes in three different color schemes: black, orange and white.

- On **white or light background**, the **Orange logo** can be used.
- On **dark or colored backgrounds**, use the **White variant**, be sure to check for contrast.
- When background demands for the logo to be seen but the coloured or white variant is not visible, the black version can be used, but it should always be checked for suitable contrast.

## Horizontal and Vertical Lockup

Never change the relationship between the Little Hotelier logomark and the wordmark when using the horizontal lockup.

For Little Hotelier, these lockups are mostly used for communications such as EDMs and the Website.

## Logomark

When there is an established familiarity with the LH brand and/or space is too limited to use the horizontal or vertical lockup, use the logomark.

The logomark is used mainly in the App header of the platform, mobile app and app stores.
