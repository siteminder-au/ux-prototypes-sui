## Logo Color

The logo comes in three different color schemes: colour (blue),  mono (dark blue), and reverse (white).

- On **white or light background**, the **coloured variant** is used.
- On **dark or colored backgrounds**, use the **reverse variant**, be sure to check for contrast.
- When background demands for the logo to be seen but the coloured or white variant is not visible, the **mono version** can be used, but it should always be checked for suitable contrast.

## Horizontal Lockup

Never change the relationship between the Siteminder logomark and the wordmark when using the horizontal lockup.

## Logomark

When there is an established familiarity with the Siteminder brand and/or space is too limited to use the horizontal lockup, use the logomark.

The logomark is used mainly in the App header together with 'SiteMinder' company name appears here in text. This can be customised by product or partner name.

## Branding Across Products

The Siteminder coloured logomark is used alongside the 'Siteminder' text in **Noto Sans and 18px font size**; the specific product(s) must be indicated and seperated by a pipe symbol (|).
