## Usage

The SUI icons are set to a native dimension of 24px by 24px. However, the optical dimension is actually 20x20px or 16x16px. This ensures somewhat consistent default sizes, along with consistent line widths, whilst offering flexibility for the design of components.


## Formatting

### Sizing

Typically our icons are mostly used at 16x16px size, however you may use icons at the following sizes: 24, 20, 18, 16, 14, 12. What matters the most here is that the icon is used with the correct proportions to where and how it is being used.

For instance, icons in the corner of table cells should be used at 12x12, such as the table in the Inventory page. However in the app header, our icon buttons are sized at 24x24 which is as large as they should ever be, and one of the only places we use icons at that size across the app.

<img src={sizing} alt="Sizing" width="588" />

### Alignment

Ensure icons are always vertically aligned when using with text.

<img src={alignment} alt="Alignment" width="252" />

### Style

For a guide on how to design and draw icons, please go [here](/docs/foundations-icons--creating-icons).
- Icons are stroked by 2px.
- Certain shapes may be filled, for illustrative effect, but the overall style is a stroked icon. See icon 'stop-sell-availability' for an example.
- Always use rounded caps and joins.
- Always set a slight border radius, depending largely on the icon.

### Colour

The default icon colour is `$app-black` / `$grey-neu-black`. You may use icons in any colour within the SUI colour palette, provided it is meeting accessibility.

You may only use icons in a single colour, we do not allow two-toned colours.

**If using icons with text, please keep everything in the same colour.**


## Best practice

- Keep icons and text the same colour
- Where possible use icons with supporting texts or labels.
- Please consider internationalisation when choosing an icon. Will this icon translate well in all our supported languages?
- Do not use an icon at smaller than 12x12px.
- Do not overuse icons. Icons should help with cognitive load and allow users to scan things quickly. Too many icons may do the opposite.
- Ensure icons are used consistently throughout our app.
