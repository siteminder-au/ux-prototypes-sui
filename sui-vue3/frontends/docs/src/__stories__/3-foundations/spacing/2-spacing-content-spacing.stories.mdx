- [Visual rhythm](#visual-rhythm)


## Visual rhythm

In order to reduce cognitive load on our users, and ensure everything we design and build is clear and easy to understand, a visual rhythm (or spacing)
rule should be established that falls within the 8px baseline grid, i.e. it should be a multiple of 8.

### Global elements

- The sm-container has a **max-width of 1140px** and is centre aligned, unless it is set at full-width which is only used on certain pages with very wide, data heavy tables.
- The sm-container should have **&gt;1366 padding: 48px 56px** (48 top and bottom, 56 left and right).
- The sm-container should have **&lt;1367 padding: 48px 32px**.
- The margin under the page title should be **40px**.
- If you are using filters, ensure the space below is **24px**.

### Page content: large

Spacing between stacked content should be **24px**. An example of large content would be stacked cards that are roughly 80–100px+ in height, although this may vary depending on the content.

### Page spacing: small

Spacing between small stacked content should be **16px**. An example of small content would be stacked cards that are roughly 72px or less, in height.

### Content spacing
- Spacing between sections and around content is **24px** for medium components
- Spacing between sections and around content is **16px** for small components
- Spacing between sections and around content is **56/48px** for large components (see wizard below). Using your own spatial judgement is necessary here as well.

More larger, complex components, such as the wizard, need bigger margins and padding due to the sheer size and space that it takes up on the screen.
