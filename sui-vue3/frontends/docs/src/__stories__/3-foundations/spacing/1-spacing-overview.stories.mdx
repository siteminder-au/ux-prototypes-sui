    To ensure consistency and to help our product be designed and built efficiently, we use a hybrid 4/8pt grid, with set spacing variables to use in our app.

## Why do we use a hybrid 4/8pt grid?

SUI uses set spacing variables all of which are a multiple of either a 4 or an 8.
The reason we have set variables is so that visually, we have a consistent
rhythm throughout our app. This is often referred to as vertical rhythm.

The reason SUI uses a 8pt grid is because it scales perfectly no matter what
device the user is on. Many popular design systems use this grid so that the
components scale perfectly despite the scale being used:
@0.75, @1, @1.5, @2, @3, etc.

## What spacing variables are available

Another hugely important reason we have set variables is so that we can easily communicate with the product engineers which spacing variable to use.
Below you will find a complete list of the spacing variables available, and what they are named. **These are available to your engineers in Tailwind.**

```ts dark
px: '4px',
'0': '0',
'4': '4px',
'8': '8px',
'12': '12px',
'16': '16px',
'20': '20px',
'24': '24px',
'32': '32px',
'40': '40px',
'48': '48px',
'56': '56px',
'64': '64px',
'72': '72px',
'80': '80px',
'96': '96px',
'112': '112px',
'128': '128px',
'160': '160px',
'192': '192px',
'224': '224px',
'256': '256px',
'320': '320px',
'384': '384px',
'448': '448px',
'512': '512px',
'640': '640px',
'768': '768px',
'896': '896px',
'1024': '1024px',
```

These spacing variables can affect properties such as: `padding`, `margin`, `width`, `height`, `maxHeight`, `gap`, `inset`, `space`, and `translate`.
If the property directly affects the visual rhythm of your page layout then you should be using a spacing variable.
**This should also be detailed in your dev handoff notes.**

Essentially, we use a 4pt grid up until `'24'` and then we switch to an 8pt grid up until `'96'`.

If there is a spacing variable that you would like added, that is a multiple of 8, please get in contact with the SUI team to have it added.

<div className="sui-storybook-highlight sui-storybook-highlight--warning">
  Please strive to always stay within our variables. We understand that with really small or detailed components, it can sometimes be impossible,
  but wherever possible you must stick to the spacing set within the SUI components, to reduce confusion between design and engineering.
</div>

### Why is having set variables important?
- It takes a lot of the guesswork out of spacing to help designers deliver a clear, polished, and consistent layout.
- Not having a consistent unit of measurement can lead to layout inconsistencies between pages, particularly on projects with two or more designers.
