## Accessibility

Please keep accessibility in mind when choosing colours, as it is our responsibility to deliver a product that's inclusive to everyone.

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) specify specific ratios that achieve the minimum required contrast for legibility.

- Small text is any size **below 24px** and requires a **4.5:1 contrast ratio**.
- Large text is anything **above 24px** and requires a **3:1 contrast ratio**.
- Graphical elements, such as data visualizations, also require a **3:1 contrast ratio**.

It is recommended to avoid pure black text on white that has a 21:1 contrast. For some people, such high contrast creates visual stress. The symptoms are perceptual distortion such as blurring, duplication, a flickering of the visual stimulus—known as Irlen syndrome.


## Colourblind Accessibility

It's a good idea to put your colour scheme to the test with a colourblind simulation app like Color Oracle.It's a good idea to put your colour scheme to the test with a colourblind simulation app like Color Oracle.

### Monochromacy / Achromatopsia (Extremely rare)

People with monochromatic vision can see no colour at all and their world consists of different shades of grey ranging from black to white,
rather like seeing the world on an old black and white television set. Achromatopsia is a specific eye condition in which people see in greyscale.
