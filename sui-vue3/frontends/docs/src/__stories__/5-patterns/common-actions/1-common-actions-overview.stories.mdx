## Add

Add is a function that adds an existing object to a list, collection, or system. For example, adding a new rate plan or adding a new date range for applicable dates.
<div className="sui-storybook-highlight"><strong>Note:</strong> This is an Add action, which means there is already a set of items that are existing. If there are no existing items in a list, collection, system or page (empty states) please use the Create action.</div>

  ### Emphasis, placement and behaviour
  The emphasis for this function might be high, medium, or low depending on the importance of the add action on the page.

  #### High emphasis
  For high emphasis actions such as being the main action within the page, a <strong>primary button</strong> should be used, with all others being secondary. Since a primary button is used, there is no need to add a prefix or suffix icon.

  An add action is usually placed at the right end of the page title. The primary action should only appear once on a page.

  ##### Behaviour
  Most creation wizards are triggered with this action. Custom dialogs/modals can also be triggered by this action if there are no steps that needs to be followed like in the wizard.
  <img src={addHigh} alt="Add action on high emphasis mode" />

  #### Medium to low emphasis
  Medium - low emphasis are actions that are part of a bigger flow such as adding a new bed room in  a room type or adding a new date range when setting up an automatic closure in yield rules. The <strong>text button</strong> is used in these cases and a <strong>controls-add (+) prefix icon</strong> is used.

  ##### Behaviour
  Custom dialogs/modals can also be triggered by this action, or a new set of items automatically adds when the action is clicked or tapped.
  <img src={addMidToLow} alt="Add action on Medium to low emphasis mode" />

  If the action is part of a context menu (dropdown actions) an <strong>sm-vertical-nav-item</strong> with an <strong>controls-add (+) prefix icon.</strong>

  ##### Behaviour
  Custom dialogs/modals/drawers can be triggered by this action.

  ##### Copy guideline
  Use the verb (Add to) in context menus together with the item you are adding it to.
  <img src={addContextMenu} alt="Add action on context menu" width="250" />


## Archive
Archive is an action to store inactive information that will no longer be used on a daily basis. Usually is part of a context menu (dropdown actions) an <strong>sm-vertical-nav-item </strong> with a <strong>prefix icon.</strong>

  ### Behaviour
  Custom dialogs/modals/drawers can be triggered by this action, where users can choose which category they would like to assign the item to.

  ### Copy guideline
  Only use the verb in context menus as it is clear which item on a list they are assigning
  <div className="row">
  <div className="column"><img src={archiveDialog} alt="Archive action on Dialog" width="450" /></div>
  <div className="column"><img src={archiveContextMenu} alt="Archive action on context menu" width="250" /></div>
  </div>

## Assign
Assign action allocates a specific item in a particular category. This the action is usually part of a context menu an <strong>sm-vertical-nav-item</strong> with the <strong>action-assign prefix icon.</strong>
<img src={assignAction} alt="Assign action on context menu" width="600" />

  ### Behaviour
  Custom dialogs/modals/drawers can be triggered by this action, where users can choose which category they would like to assign the item to.
  <img src={assignBehavior} alt="Drawer opened by assign action" />

  ### Copy guideline
  Only use the verb in context menus as it is clear which item on a list they are assigning.

## Audit
Monitoring user activity within the application. When auditing an item, a modal appears showing all activities performed for that item. The audit action is usually part of a context menu (dropdown actions) an <strong>sm-vertical-nav-item</strong> with a <strong>section-audit prefix icon.</strong>
<img src={auditAction} alt="Audit action on context menu" />

  ### Copy guideline
  Only use the verb (Audit) in context menus as it is clear which item on a list they are auditing.

  ### Behaviour
  Custom dialogs/modals/drawers can be triggered by this action.
  <img src={auditBehavior} alt="Drawer opened by audit action" />

## Back
Takes the user back to the first step in a series of stages, like in a wizard. Use in place of previous. For <strong>wizards,</strong>  a <strong>text button</strong> with an <strong>arrow-go-back prefix icon</strong> is used.
<img src={backActionWizard} alt="Back action on a wizard" />

For <strong>main pages,</strong> a <strong>secondary button</strong> with an <strong>arrow-go-back prefix icon</strong> is to be used. This should be placed at the top left of the page above the heading. It is recommended to indicate where or which page the user is going back to (i.e. Back to plugins, Back to list).
<img src={backActionPage} alt="Back action on a page" />

## Cancel
This action removes all selected fields or choices. For controls that always have a selection or value, such as radio buttons, the default selection or value is often re-established when cleared is performed.

  ### Behaviour
  Stops the action from being performed. Closes the dialog, drawer, or any modal type component. Also used to discard information, such as alerts, warnings and prompts.
  For <strong>dialog, drawer,</strong> or any<strong> modal type component</strong>, use a <strong>tertiary button.</strong>
  <div className="row">
  <div className="column"><img src={cancelBehaviorDialog} alt="Cancel action on dialog" width="450" /></div>
  <div className="column"><img src={cancelBehaviorCard} alt="Cancel action on editable card" width="300" /></div>
  </div>

## Clear
This action removes all selected fields or choices. For controls that always have a selection or value, such as radio buttons, the default selection or value is often re-established when cleared is performed.
<img src={clearAction} alt="Clear action used on filters" />

## Close
Close dismisses the current page, dialog, modal, toast or menu. Close is also used to discard information, such as alerts, warnings and prompts.

Utilise the <strong>action-cross icon (x),</strong> which is normally located on the upper right side of the element.

Do not use close copy in a button.
<img src={closeAction} alt="Close action used on dialog and toast" width="650" />

## Context menu
The context menu enables users to access to functionality directly connected to an item without cluttering the UI. Use a <strong>button-icon</strong> for this with the <strong>action-context-menu icon.</strong>
  ### Behaviour
  On click, a dropdown is to appear as a "menu" where it overlays the target button. The active-label prop should be labelled as <strong>"ACTIONS”.</strong>
  <img src={contextAction} alt="Close action used on dialog and toast" width="950" />

  ### Considerations
  - <strong>When deciding which things to include in a context menu, prioritize relevance. </strong>
  <br />  A context menu isn't intended to provide complicated or seldom used items; rather, it allows consumers to swiftly access the instructions they're most likely to require in their present environment.
  - <strong> Aim for a limited amount of menu options. </strong>
  <br /> A large context menu might be tough to scan and scroll through.
  - <strong>Context menus should be enabled uniformly across your program. </strong>
  <br /> If you give context menus for things in some locations but not others, users may be confused and may believe there is a problem.
  - <strong>Keep submenus to one level if you need to control the complexity of a menu.</strong>
  <br />A submenu is a menu item that opens a secondary menu with instructions that are logically connected.

## Copy
Copy creates a copy of an item in a different location that you specify.
  ### High emphasis
   For high emphasis actions such as being the main action within the page, a primary button should be used, with  Since a primary button is used, there is no need to add a prefix or suffix icon.
  #### Placement:
  Action is usually placed right side of the label being copied. The primary action should only appear once on a page.
  ##### Behaviour
  Add a confirmation message that the action has taken place.
  - <strong>For bulk actions:</strong> upon a click or press of copy action, have indicators which sections the item has been copied to,
  <br /> and have an option to reset or save the changes.
  - <strong>For individual/instant copy actions:</strong>  upon a click or press of copy, a confirmation "copied" tooltip appears.
   <br />

<img src={copyHighEmphasis1} alt="Close action used on dialog and toast" width="950"/>
<img src={copyHighEmphasis2} className="mt-40" alt="Close action used on dialog and toast" width="550"/>

  ### Medium to Low Emphasis
   Most of the time this is a secondary action that appears in a popover / dropdown menu. Use an <strong>action-copy prefix icon </strong> and indicate in your label what item is being copied (i.e. Copy rate configuration)

  This action can open a dialog or modal that requires more action to be performed or automatically copy the item.It is recommended that upon a click or press of copy, a confirmation "copied" tooltip appears.
  <img src={copyMidLowEmphasis} alt="Close action used on context menu" width="950"/>

## Create
Generates a new item from scratch. (for example, creating their first room type or creating a new promotion code). This is used for empty states. If there are already existing items on the page, use the Add action.
  ### Behaviour
  Most creation wizards are triggered with this action. Custom dialogs/modals can also be triggered by this action if there are no steps that needs to be followed like in the wizard.
  <img src={createAction} alt="Create action used on empty states" />

## Delete
The delete function erases an item. (for example, deletes a room type or deletes a value from a table cell).

Delete actions are often irreversible and permanent. Inform the user of any unwanted implications that may occur if an item is deleted, such as data loss. This is usually part of a context menu (dropdown actions) an <strong>sm-vertical-nav-item</strong> with an <strong>action-remove prefix icon.</strong> Sometimes the delete action is part of a bigger flow such as editing a room type , in this case use the <strong>secondary-warning button</strong> with <strong>action-remove prefix icon.</strong>

Use the <strong>action-remove icon</strong> for actions requiring deleting.
<img src={deleteAction} alt="Delete action used on context menu and modal drawer" width="650" />

  ### High impact deletion
   Present a warning dialog for confirmation when recreating data would be extremely time-consuming. Additionally use a warning dialog if the action deletes a huge amount of data or if the action deletes other critical things.

  In addition to displaying a dialog, you can have a checkbox to confirm that the user understands what they are about to do. (manual confirmation).

  <div className="sui-storybook-highlight"><strong>Note:</strong> If you are using a not so common action such as <strong>deactivating</strong> or <strong>disconnecting</strong> - this behavior is also recommended provided the actions are going to impact other data in the platform.</div>
  <img src={deleteActionHigh} alt="Delete action used for high impact deletion on dialog" width="900" />

  ### Moderate impact deletion
   Used when an action cannot be reversed or data cannot be simply regenerated. This pattern is also useful if you're deleting more than one thing. In this cases, an alert dialog can be used/

  Request confirmation of the deletion, along with information about what will happen if they are removed.
  <img src={deleteActionModerate} alt="Delete action used for moderate impact deletion on dialog" />

  ### Low impact deletion
   When undoing a deletion or recreating data is simple. Erase the data without notice when you click or tap the delete action.
  <div className="sui-storybook-highlight"><strong>Note:</strong> For low impact deletion, <strong>if space permits</strong> - use a <strong>text button</strong> with <strong>action-remove prefix icon.</strong> <br />On the other hand, <strong>if space is limited,</strong> an <strong>action-remove icon-button</strong> is recommended. Consider internationalisation and localisations when determining if whether to use text-button+icon or just plain icon.</div>
  <img src={deleteActionLow} alt="Delete action used for low impact deletion on forms" width="450" />

  ### Considerations for Accessibility for Designers and Developers
  If an icon in the interface has a purpose, it should be communicated to the user via assistive technology. You should <strong>specify a suitable aria-label in this situation.</strong>

  For example, if the action-remove icon in the UI removes a date range, add <strong> aria-label="Remove date range"</strong>
  <img src={deleteConsideration} alt="Delete action used in selecting date range in forms" />

  ### Post-deletion
  Confirm the removal of data from the list or page and display a success message. If the deletion fails, send a notice to the user informing them that the deletion failed.
  <img src={postDeletion} alt="Success toast message after deleting a promotion code" />

## Duplicate
Duplicate creates an exact copy of an item (all its content and sub items) in the same location as the original. This is usually part of a context menu (dropdown actions) an <strong>sm-vertical-nav-item</strong> with a <strong>prefix icon.</strong>

Use the <strong>action-duplicate icon</strong> for this action. When an item is duplicated, it will copy and paste whatever item you select and place it right below the original one.

  ### Behaviour
  If there is an action before duplicating the item (i.e., renaming) use a dialog confirmation and have a cancel button so users can opt out. Once an item is confirmed for duplication, have a success toast appear for successful duplication and  have the duplicate appear right below the original one.
  <img src={duplicateAction} alt="Duplicate action used in a context menu, dialog and success toast message after duplicating an promotional code item" />

## Edit
Editing allows you to update data or values. Edit often causes the targeted object or input item's state to change. Provide edit as a menu item, or an icon button. Use the<strong> action-edit icon</strong> for this action.

  ### As menu item
  When using as a menu item, the edit action opens up a drawer where the user can edit the specific item.
  <img src={editAsMenu} alt="Edit used in context menu and drawer triggered by the edit action" />

  ### As icon button
  When using as an <strong>action-edit icon button,</strong> the edit action <strong>changes the editable card into editing mode.</strong>
  <img src={editAsButton} alt="Edit used in a card and card in editable state triggered by the edit action" />

  ### Copy Considerations
  - If it is clear what item the user will be editing, the verb (Edit) is enough to indicate the action.
  <img src={editCopyOne} alt="Edit copy consideration in context menu " />

  - If there are multiple edit or update actions in a context menu, use the verb (Edit) plus the item they will be editing.
  <img src={editCopyTwo} alt="Copy consideration for multiple edit actions in context menu" />

## Get started
The get started action is used for add-on features for customers. Being the main action within the feature landing page, a <strong>primary button</strong> should be used, with all others being secondary. Since a primary button is used, there is <strong>no need to add a prefix or suffix icon.</strong>

Get started action is usually placed at the right end of the page title. The primary action appears on top of the page with the same action appearing as a secondary button at the bottom as an upsell.

  ### Behaviour
  A creation wizard is triggered with this action, allowing the customer to set up their account/details for the add-on feature.
  <img src={getStartedAction} alt="Get started used as primary button for an upsell page and a wizard triggered by the get started action" />

## Go to
Go to action allows the user to go to another page <strong>within the platform.</strong>

  ### As a button
  When using as a button, use the <strong>arrow-go-forward suffix icon</strong> together with a copy of where the user will be redirected. Alternatively, if your interface is sectioned and is clear where the user will be redirected an <strong>action verb</strong> together with the <strong>arrow-go-forward suffix icon</strong> will suffice.
  <img src={goToButton} alt="Go to action used in a card as button" />

  ### As menu item
  When used as a <strong>menu item,</strong> the go to action redirects the user to a specific page in the platform. In some cases, you can use the <strong>arrow-go-forward icon</strong> together with “Go to” copy of where the user will be redirected.
  <img src={goToMenu1} alt="Go to action used in context menu with arrow-forward-action and Go to copy" width="300" />

  In some scenarios,  a different verb rather than “Go to” can be used together with an icon that is more applicable to the copy (ie. Update in settings).
  <img src={goToMenu2} alt="Go to action used in context menu with applicable icon and different verb copy" width="300" />

## Import
This action brings a file from a different program into the platform. This is usually part of a context menu (dropdown actions) an <strong>sm-vertical-nav-item</strong> with a  <strong>prefix icon.</strong>

Use the <strong>action-import prefix icon</strong> for this action.
<img src={importAction} alt="Import action used in context menu." />

## Learn more
If more information is present but does not make sense in the immediate context, insert it towards the end of inline text as a <strong>secondary / text button</strong> with an <strong>arrow-go-forward suffix icon.</strong>

If space is limited using 'Learn more' is acceptable, but make sure to <strong>describe the purpose of a link in HTML using aria-label. (i.e. aria-label="Learn more about help center")</strong>
<img src={learnMoreAction} alt="Import action used in context menu." width="850" />

<div className="sui-storybook-highlight">Alternatively, you can consider rewriting the learn more labels to a more descriptive label rather than the stand alone “Learn more” text.</div>

  ### What to Say Instead
  #### Option 1: Keep the Learn More structure and supplement with descriptive keywords.
  If there is room, provide relevant language that summarizes the topic you are linking to beside Learn more. There are situations when retaining Learn more is okay provided you qualify it with information about what is to be learned (e.g., Learn more about our services).

  The disadvantages of this method include space limitations for the lengthier label and poor scannability because the important keywords appear towards the end of the phrase rather than at the beginning. Yet, a lengthy connection creates a larger target, which users may click and touch on faster than a short target.
  <img src={learnMoreOption1} alt="Import action used in context menu." width="850" className="img-padding" />

  #### Option 2: Use keywords that define the destination of the link.
  This is the most common and, typically, the best approach. To do this, you have to look at the destination page and see what it's about.
  <img src={learnMoreOption2} alt="Import action used in context menu." width="850" className="img-padding" />

## Link out
Link out actions appears a <strong>text buttons</strong> using the <strong>action-open-in-new as suffix icon.</strong>

Link out actions opens external links in a new tab. These links are <strong>only used when users are taken to a different site.</strong> By accessing the URL in a new tab, you will help users. They won't have to click Back numerous times to return to your site once they've finished going through the other site.

If it's the within platform but a different page, users will use the navigation menu to navigate back or elsewhere if they need.

See: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G200.html" target="_blank"> G200: Opening new windows and tabs from a link only when necessary</a>
<img src={linkOutAction} alt="Link out action used in pages"/>

## Next
Takes the user to the following stage in a series of steps, like in a wizard. This is represented by a <strong>primary button</strong> with an <strong>arrow-go-forward suffix icon.</strong>
<img src={nextAction} alt="Next action used in pages"/>

## Remove
This operation clears an item or list item. Remove differs from delete in that a removed item is not permanently lost. Several items can be removed at the same time.

  ### Hierarchy and placement
  Represent remove as an <strong>action-cross icon.</strong> The action is <strong>rarely the key action on the page</strong> and should be avoided at all costs. This is usually used in filters, when tags are shown.
  <img src={removeAction} alt="Remove action used in pages"/>

## Reset
Reset returns values to their most recently stored state. The values saved the last time the user clicked or triggered Save are included in the last saved state.

Reset is commonly used as a text button with the <strong>action-reset prefix icon.</strong>
<img src={resetAction} alt="Reset action used in Inventory page"/>

## Save
Saves any current changes to a file or item. The window or panel is automatically closed and a toast shows to indicate successful saving.

For high emphasis actions such as being the main action within the page, a <strong>primary button</strong> should be used, with all others being secondary. Since a primary button is used, there is <strong>no need to add a prefix or suffix icon.</strong>
<img src={saveAction} alt="Save action used in card and successful toast message triggered after successful saving"/>

## Select all

Checks/unchecks every checkbox or adds every object in the display to the selection set.
<img src={selectAction} alt="Save action used in card and successful toast message triggered after successful saving" width="650"/>
