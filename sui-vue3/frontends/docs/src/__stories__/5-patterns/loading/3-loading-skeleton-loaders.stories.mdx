  <h1>Skeleton loaders</h1>
  <p>Skeleton loaders are an excellent way to load parts of a page without completely disrupting the users experience, which spinners and other explicit loading patterns do. They present the user with a low fidelity representation of the interface. They help users to perceive loading times as shorter than they actually are, and also allow parts of a page to load independently of each other.</p>

## Components to use

### Loading bar skeleton loaders

This loader is best used in circumstances where our other variants will not work, however always try to use one of the other variants as they have been designed to suit our existing components.

sm-loading-bar has customisable height and width. Set the width and height yourself by following our spacing guide and choosing a variable from our <a href="https://sui-dev-v3-sui-docs.dev.siteminderlabs.com/?path=/story/foundations-spacing--overview">list of spacing variables</a>. This component needs to inherit an existing variable or it will not display correctly or at all.
<img src={skeletonLoadingBar} className="img-padding"  alt="Loading bar skeleton loader" width="640"/>

### Card skeleton loaders

  #### Standard
  The standard card skeleton loader is fully responsive, within its container, and each card has a max width of 348px wide. You can add as many cards to this component using the count property, i.e. count="4".
  <img src={skeletonCardStandard} className="img-padding"  alt="Standard card skeleton loader" width="720"/>

  #### Stacked
  You can change the card layout to a list style layout, for pages like Room Types. These span the whole container and also accept the count property.
  <img src={skeletonCardStacked} className="img-padding"  alt="Stacked card skeleton loader" width="720"/>

### Full-page skeleton loaders
Skeleton loaders are beneficial for loading pages that have content with predictable layouts, such as the homepage. This makes skeleton loaders ideal for giving users an idea of the forthcoming content. Ideally, all content areas should load simultaneously, if feasible.

#### Dashboard
We have created a number of dashboard cards specifically for the dashboard loading state. These consist of  a long card, a small card and a graph card. The sm-loading-dashboard combines all of these into one layout, however each card can be used individually.
<img src={skeletonDashboard} className="img-padding"  alt="Dashboard skeleton loader" width="800" />

#### Home screen
When no part of the website has loaded but there is still a need for a loading placeholder skeleton you can use the home screen variant. This loader is responsive and will adjust to the tablet layout at sub 769 px wid
<img src={skeletonHomeScreen} className="img-padding"  alt="Home screen skeleton loader" />


### Form skeleton loaders
Form skeleton loaders are used to indicate the loading status of a form or input fields. They can display placeholders or outline the form elements to provide a visual indication of where users can input data. This helps users understand that the form is being loaded and provides context for the upcoming interactions.
<img src={skeletonForm} className="img-padding"  alt="Form skeleton loader" width="480" />

### Image skeleton loaders
Image skeleton loaders are used when loading images or thumbnails. Instead of displaying blank spaces, a placeholder image with a predefined size and aspect ratio is shown. It may contain a simplified version of the actual image or a generic image representation until the real image is loaded.
<img src={skeletonImage} className="img-padding"  alt="Image skeleton loader" width="320" />

  #### Lazy loading image
  The sm-lazy-image provides a loading placeholder while an image is being loaded and an error image when it fails.
  The component will only begin to load once its visible on the screen.
  The width and height of the image must be set in the implementation.
  <img src={skeletonLazyLoadingImage} className="img-padding"  alt="Lazy loading image skeleton loader" width="320" />


### List skeleton loaders
List skeleton loaders are suitable for situations where a dynamic list of items, such as articles or products, needs to be loaded. They typically show a series of placeholders that resemble the layout of the list of items.

This accepts the count property so you can set as many rows as you require.
<img src={skeletonList} className="img-padding"  alt="List skeleton loader" />

### Table skeleton loaders
These are used to indicate the loading status of tables or data grids. They are particularly useful when loading large amounts of tabular data that may take some time to fetch or process.
<img src={skeletonTable} className="img-padding"  alt="Table skeleton loader" />

## When to use
Skeletons should accurately represent the content and should only be used in predictable sections of a page. It's important for the content within a container to load simultaneously to avoid a disjointed experience with elements loading at different speeds.

A shimmer animation is used to further reduce perceived load time. Skeleton is a playful yet effective way to prepare the user for the actual content being loaded and gives the user a sense of what to expect, thus reducing cognitive load on the user.
