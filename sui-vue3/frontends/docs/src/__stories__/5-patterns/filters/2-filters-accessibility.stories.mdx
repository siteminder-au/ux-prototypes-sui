The filter pattern depends on the accessibility characteristics of a number of other components:
  - Text field
  - Select
  - Multi-select
  - Tags
  - Buttons
  - Date Picker
  - Selection controls

Please ensure that your filter pattern is accessible as a whole. User should be able to:
  - Detect and understand all control labels
  - Alerted of any changes to the state
  - Carry out tasks with the keyboard
