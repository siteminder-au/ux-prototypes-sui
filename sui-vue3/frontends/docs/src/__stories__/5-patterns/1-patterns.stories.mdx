## What are design patterns?

Design patterns are recurring solutions that solve common design problems.

UI design generally leverages patterns which already exist within many of the user interfaces we all utilise. For example, a breadcrumb is a common pattern used to provide orientation and navigation within an information hierarchy.

A pattern may be a single component or a recurring assemblage of specific components. It may operate within a single view or as a flow spanning a number of steps.

## Why should we document them?

Documenting design patterns provides a common language that can be used by our multi-disciplinary teams. This allows for clear and efficient communication.

Additionally, some complex patterns may not be easily recognised as patterns without formalising and naming them.

## What is documented here?

1. Complex patterns which may not be easily recognised as patterns without being formalised here.
2. Common patterns with specific guidelines for use across SM domains.

The above will fall into one of the following categories:
1. Content agnostic: a pattern which is content agnostic and can therefore be used across a range of contexts.
2. Domain specific: A pattern that presents SM domain specific concepts in a formalised manner. It may build upon a content agnostic pattern or stand alone.

## What is not documented here?

Single component patterns with no specific guidelines for usage within SM domains. These are documented under components.

## What are anti-patterns?

A risk when we formalise patterns is they get picked up and used in a context where they seem appropriate but end up introducing confusion.
