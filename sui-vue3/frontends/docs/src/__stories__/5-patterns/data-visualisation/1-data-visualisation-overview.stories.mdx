## Product context
Our platform employs various approaches to displaying data visualisation, and the main objective of this pattern is to clearly document and explain each method's usage. This ensures that we create a platform that is unified and consistent in its implementation. <br /> <br />
<div className="sui-storybook-highlight">SiteMinder Platform uses the <a href="https://www.highcharts.com/docs/index"> Highcharts library </a> that comes with  the tools you need to create reliable and secure data visualisations.</div>

## Usage

  ### Exploration and analysis
  Data visualisation helps users explore and compare data, spot trends, and gain insights effectively.

  ### Communication
  Data visualisation is a good way to present and communicate findings and insights to both technical and non-technical users. Presenting complex data through visualisation makes it more understandable and accessible.

  ### Monitoring
  Data visualisations are used to monitor real-time periodic data and report on performance or progress.

  ### Forecasting or prediction
  Using time-series visualisations, such as line charts, is important for forecasting future trends using past data.

  ### Decision-making
  Data visualisations assist in decision-making by offering a clear and brief summary of data. They support well-informed decision-making.

  ### Customer insights
  Data visualisations are used to understand/grasp customer actions, behavior and demographic information to targeted business efforts.



## Types
<div className="sui-storybook-highlight sui-storybook-highlight--alert">These types of charts are the common ones you will see on the SiteMinder platform. If there is a chart that your product needs that is not listed here, you can view the <a href="https://www.highcharts.com/docs/index"> Highcharts library </a>.</div>

### Comparison
A comparison chart is a visual tool used for comparing items, categories, or data points to emphasize their similarities, differences, or trends. It enables a fast and straightforward comparison of different elements.

  #### Bar and Column charts
  Column charts display data as vertical bars. A feature of column charts allows for different data to be compared alongside one another. It is similar to bar charts, the difference being that bar charts have a horizontal representation of the data.

  The bar chart is exactly the same as a column chart only the x-axis and y-axis are switched.

  #### Stacked bar charts
  Stacked bar charts show relationships and differences in complex categories, while stacked column charts indicate group relationships in smaller ordered sections of data.

### Time series
Trends are used to illustrate how data points change over time, allowing users to identify patterns, fluctuations, and trends.

  #### Line chart
  Line charts are one of the most common ways to visualize trends over time. They connect data points with lines, making it easy to see the direction and magnitude of changes.

  #### Spline chart
  A spline chart is a smoothed line chart. It is a type of data visualisation that uses a curved line (spline) to connect data points on a graph. Spline charts are particularly useful when working with data that has fluctuations or variations, and they are often used in time-series data or data sets where smoothness and continuity are important.

  #### Area chart
  Area charts are like line charts but with filled colours or patterns below the lines. Stacked area charts help compare contributions within a category by showing how each data series contributes to the total value.

### Compositions (part-to-whole)
This refers to the presentation and analysis of data that represents parts within a whole.  useful for showing how individual components relate to the total or how they compare to each other within a specific context.

  #### Pie chart
  The classic example of composition data visualisation. They represent data as slices of a circular "pie," with each slice representing a portion or percentage of the whole. Pie charts are ideal for illustrating the composition of a single categorical dataset.
  <img src={typesCompositionPie} className="img-padding" alt="Pie chart as composition chart sample" width="480"/>

  ### Donut chart
  Donut charts are similar to pie charts but have a hole in the center. They are useful for comparing multiple composition datasets in a single visualisation.
  <img src={typesCompositionDonut} className="img-padding" alt="Donut chart as composition chart sample" width="480"/>

### Spatial
Spatial charts are used to visualize data that is related to specific geographical locations. They help convey information about geographic patterns, distribution, and relationships.

  #### Choropleth Maps
  These maps use colour shading or patterns to represent data values within predefined geographical regions, such as countries, states, or counties. They are effective for displaying regional variations or concentrations of data.
  <img src={typesSpatial} className="img-padding" alt="Choropleth map as spatial chart sample"/>

### Combination chart
A combination chart compares data in various categories over time by combining two or three types of charts. It typically uses both bar and line charts, but it can also include area or dot charts for showing data relationships.

## Chart anatomy
Understanding the elements constructing each chart is essential for effectively interpreting and creating charts.

**1: Title -** The title is a descriptive label that summarizes the purpose or content of the chart. It provides context for what the chart represents. Usually located at the top of the chart.

**2: Subtitle (optional)** - Additional descriptive label or content of the chart. Located at the below the title of the chart.

**3: Axes**
- **X-Axis - ** Also known as the horizontal axis, represents the independent variable or categories being compared. It typically runs horizontally along the bottom of the chart.
- **Y-Axis - ** Also known as the vertical axis, represents the dependent variable or the values being measured. It runs vertically along the side of the chart.

**4: Labels -** Labels include text elements that provide additional information or context for data points, axes, or other chart elements. They can include category labels and data value labels.

**5: Axis labels -** Axis labels provide information about the units, categories, or scales represented on the x-axis and y-axis.

**6: Grid lines -** Grid lines are horizontal and vertical lines that help readers interpret data values and relationships on the chart. They provide a reference for reading data points.

**7: Tick marks -** Tick marks are small marks or intervals along the axes that help in reading and interpreting data values.

**8: Legends -** Legends provide a summary of the unique visual features, like colours or patterns, used in the chart. They help users make sense of the chart by assisting them in connecting these visual cues with their meanings.

**9: Date series -** Data series are the actual data points or data sets plotted on the chart. In a bar chart, for example, each bar represents a data series.

**10: Tooltip-** Additional text or call outs added to the chart to provide explanations or highlight specific points of interest. When you hover over specific chart elements, additional information or context is displayed. A tooltip should show the values of the data point on both axes and any other relevant details.

**11: Chart area -** The space where data is shown as graphics or numbers.

**12: Actions (optional) - ** Additional components on which the user can perform actions such as filtering data by days, months, etc.
