## Table editing

### When to use table editing
- When presenting the user with tabular data (data that requires headings/columns and rows)
- The data that is be edited should be relatively simple data

<img src={when} alt="When to use" width="760" />


## Example in use
Below you can see an example of our Rates list pattern using table editing.
<img src={example} alt="When to use" width="760" />

## Recommendations
When using this pattern, keep the following recommendations in mind:

- Adjust the presentation to make the table data more readable.
- Try to follow the standard cell navigational standards that consumers are already familiar with (e.g., in Microsoft Excel).


## How to build
This pattern is built using the sm-table component, where sm-input and sm-select can be placed inside individual cells to allow editing.
