## Progressive editing

### When to use progressive editing
- When the user is doing a lot of detailed editing (such as writing translations) and would like to progressively save their progress
- When the user is making edits to a page that is not a modal, or 'modal-like' (i.e Drawer) in which the edits can be saved but the user can still stay on the page
- Full-page editing works very well with progressive editing, often hand-in-hand (such as the Translations page or the Inventory Grid)


## Example in use
Before any edits are made the action buttons are disabled:
<img src={example} alt="Progressive editing after edits are made" width="960" />

And now, after edits are made the user can then save them with the now active action buttons:
<img src={exampleTwo} alt="Progressive editing before any edits are made" width="960" />

Ensure the save button has a count of all the changes being made:
<img src={anatomy} alt="Ensure the save button has a count" width="960" />

## Recommendations
When using this pattern, keep the following recommendations in mind:

- Try to ensure the save button is easy to spot so that users know they need to save the data before the changes take effect
- Always make sure there is a count of all the changes that have been made in the primary save button label



## How to build
This pattern can be built using a range of components, however the constants are the save and discard buttons, and they tend to be used in conjunction with an sm-table edit using a full-page layout.
