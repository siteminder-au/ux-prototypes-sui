## Drawer editing

### When to use drawer editing
- If there are too many editable fields for an inline card edit
- When you don't want the user to lose orientation within the platform
- When editing items in a list with pagination and you would like the user to keep their place in the list


## Example in use
Below you can see an example layout using drawer editing.
<img src={when} alt="When to use" width="960" />

## Recommendations
When using this pattern, keep the following recommendations in mind:

- Use a drawer when what is being edited needs careful attention. This removes the likelihood of accidentally changing a critical value.
- For extra fields, refrain from using multiple overlays. Use a single overlay/drawer if you have a complicated modification for a number of items.
- Use a drawer if you don't need inline context when editing or if the editing requires the user's undivided attention.


## How to build
This pattern is built using the sm-drawer component, where the save and cancel action buttons property are set to true.
