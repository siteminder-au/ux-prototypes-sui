## Attributes of inline validation messages

- Error messages indicate that the user's input is invalid or contains errors. They highlight the specific field with an error and provide a description of the error, guiding users on how to correct it.
- Inline validation messages can specify the validation rules that apply to a particular field.
- When users provide valid and acceptable input, success messages confirm that the input meets the required criteria - often displayed in a visually distinct manner, such as with a checkmark icon or a different color to signify success.
- Required field indicators: Inline validation messages can indicate which fields are mandatory and must be filled out.
- Inline validation messages provide real-time feedback to users as they enter data, instantly indicating any errors or issues.

<div className="sui-storybook-highlight"> The implementation of validation should be customized to suit the specific requirements of the form. <br /><br />
As a general rule, if the user enters incorrect information, the system should notify them through a clear and easily understandable message that helps them rectify the error.
For instance, don't state "Field is blank." "Please enter a valid email address" is more polite and directs to a solution.</div>

## Components to use

  ### Inline validation errors
  Inputs allow the user to interact with and enter data and content. Use error validation to inform users that their input is invalid, contains errors or if they have missed a required field.
  <img src={inlineValidationError} className="img-padding" alt="Inline validation error used to indicate to enter a valid email address" width="400" />

  ### Inline validation rules
  Use input helper text to specify the validation rules that apply to a particular field.
  <img src={inlineValidationRules}  alt="Inline validation rule used to indicate a valid amount accepted for commission rate field" width="400" />


## When to use

### Inline validation errors
  - When validating user input in forms.
  - When communicating specific requirements or constraints for individual fields. For example, if a field requires a specific date format, character limit, or input pattern, inline validation can indicate when the user's input does not meet those requirements.
  - When users are creating or updating their passwords, inline validation errors can be used to indicate the strength or quality of the password.

### Inline validation rules
  - When guiding users to specific validation criteria.
  - When ensuring proper formatting of data.
  - When enforcing input constraints for specific fields.
  - When enforcing interdependencies between fields. For instance, if there are conditional fields or options that are dependent on the selection in another field, inline validation can provide feedback and guide users to make the appropriate selections to fulfill the requirements.




## Recommendations

- Use descriptive and concise language. Clearly communicate the issue or error in a brief and easily understandable manner. Avoid technical jargon.
- Provide specific feedback. Instead of generic error messages, be specific about what went wrong and how the user can fix it. <br /> Example: "Password must be at least 8 characters long and include a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters."
- Display messages near the relevant field.
- Provide real-time validation.
- Offer help and suggestions: Instead of just pointing out errors, provide guidance or suggestions to help users solve the issue <br /> Example: "Please enter a valid date (e.g., mm/dd/yyyy)."
