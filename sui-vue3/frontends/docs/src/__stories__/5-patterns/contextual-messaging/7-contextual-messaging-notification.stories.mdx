  <h1>Notifications</h1>
  <p>Notifications are messages that provide information to users about general events or changes in a system. Unlike validation messages, notifications are not necessarily related to user input or their current activity in the system. Instead, they serve to inform users about updates or events that might be relevant or interesting to them.</p>

## Attributes of notifications

- They provide updates, alerts, or relevant details about events, changes, or system states.
- They are not activated by the user's immediate actions, but rather serve to notify the user of an event that holds significance or importance.
- Triggered and displayed when an event or change occurs or when the user's attention is required.
- Notifications should be designed to be non-intrusive and respect the user's workflow. They should not disrupt or obstruct the user's current tasks, allowing them to decide when and how to interact with the notification.
- They may provide actionable options or buttons that allow users to take immediate action in response to the information provided.

## Components to use

  ### Badge
  It is used to notify users of action that has to be done or the status of an item. Badges assist in drawing attention to vital information, such as alerts or new and unread messages. They are typically used to provide secondary or supplementary information to text.

  ### Notification list
  This  displays a collection of notifications, allowing users to view and interact with them. It provides a clear and organized view of incoming information, allowing users to stay informed and take appropriate actions based on the notifications received.
  <img src={notificationList} alt="Notification list used for app header and in page" />


## When to use

### Badge
  - When highlighting new notifications or alerts that require the user's attention. For instance, a badge notification can indicate the presence of new messages, system updates, or important announcements.
  - When displaying counts related to user or platform activity or events. For example, a badge notification can show the number of unread emails or pending tasks.

### Notification list
  - When users should receive time-sensitive updates or alerts that require their immediate attention. For example, notifications about system outages, urgent messages, or time-sensitive events can be displayed in the list to ensure users are informed.
  - When communication event reminders or schedules.
  - When communicating transactional updates. For example, users can receive notifications about payment receipts or changes to their account status.
  - Notification list can act as a history or archive of past notifications, allowing users to revisit previous messages. Users can check past notifications, track their interactions, or refer to important information.


## Recommendations

- Deliver notifications that are relevant to the user.
- Keep notification messages concise, clear, and easy to understand.
- Send notifications in a timely manner, considering the urgency and relevance of the information. Avoid overwhelming users with excessive notifications and allow them to control the frequency of non-critical updates.
- Design notifications to be non-intrusive, allowing users to continue their tasks uninterrupted.
- Include clear and relevant call-to-action buttons or options within notifications, allowing users to directly respond or interact with the information provided.
