## Product context

There are several different ways of showing contextual messaging on our platform and the primary purpose of this pattern is to ensure all the different methods are outlined and detailed for usage, to ensure we are building a platform that is aligned and consistent.


## Importance of contextual messaging
Effective contextual messaging plays a vital role in enhancing the user experience. It helps users by providing timely and meaningful information that aligns with their current context or actions within the system. By delivering targeted messages, we can guide users, offer assistance, and improve overall usability.

## Types of contextual messaging

### Contextual Help / Info messages
In situations where users might require additional guidance or information, offer contextual help messages. These messages can provide instructions, tips, or links to relevant resources that assist users in understanding the system or resolving potential issues. Contextual help messages should be concise, well-timed, and at times, easily dismissible.

### Contextual prompts
Contextual prompts are strategically placed messages that appear in relevant sections of the interface. They guide users on specific actions, suggest next steps, or offer relevant recommendations based on their current context.

### Feedback messages
These are messages that provide updates on the progress of user actions, acknowledge successful completions, or indicate errors encountered during a process.

### Indicators
An indicator is a visual cue that highlights a specific element on a page, whether it's content or part of the user interface, to notify the user that it has something noteworthy or requires their attention.

### Inline validation messages
Inline validation messages offer immediate feedback to users about the accuracy of their input. These messages appear alongside form fields or input elements, helping users identify and fix any errors or omissions.

### Notifications

## Levels of messaging

### Micro Level
Small, discreet messages that are embedded within the user interface or flow, providing brief contextual information or instructions.

### Macro Level
Displayed as overlays, banners, or modals, strategically placed within the user interface to capture the user's attention. These messages aim to provide crucial information or guidance that is relevant to the user's current context or task. They serve as visual cues that deliver important updates, alerts, or instructions, ensuring that users are promptly informed and guided within their immediate context of interaction.

### System level
System-wide messages are notifications that go beyond individual interactions or screens, delivering updates, notifications, or alerts across the entire system. These messages have a broader scope, aiming to inform users about important changes, events, or system-wide updates that may impact their overall experience.
