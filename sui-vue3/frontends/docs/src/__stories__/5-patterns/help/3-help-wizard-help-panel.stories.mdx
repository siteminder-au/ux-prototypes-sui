## Usage
The wizard help panel provides useful information and answers to common questions related to the content on the page. They are permanently on-screen.

### Rules of usage
- The <strong>help panel</strong> is primarily used in the <strong>wizard component</strong>. Please don't use it in any other scenario without consulting your Design Manager or the SUI team.
- You can use the help panel on either the right hand side of the wizard or in full width as part of the main content of the wizard.

### When to use
1. When essential information is needed or critical to help users complete the wizard.
2. When presenting small previews of information to provide context in relation to the content of the wizard. By hiding most of the content, users can spend their time more efficiently focused on the wizard content.
3. If presenting content that is not critical to help the user complete the wizard, the help panel allows the user to collapse the content and move it out of the way, improving their experience.
4. If you think collapsing the content to gain more screen space will help the user complete the wizard.


### How to use
The base component for the wizard help accordion can be found in <a href="https://sui.siteminder.systems/?path=/story/components-expandable-card--expandable-card-body" target="_blank">Storybook</a>. Your engineer will need to set the `arrowPosition` property to `right` and set the styling of the background colour and border left.

An example of the component can be found <a href="https://sui.siteminder.systems/?path=/story/components-wizard--sample-help-card" target="_blank">here</a>, as a variant of the Wizard component. Please share this with your engineer so they can ensure the styling remains consistent across our app.


## Formatting

### Placement
**Right panel** : The help panel can be anchored to the right side of the wizard's content container.

- You can have multiple expandable cards on the right side of the wizard if you want to give users an overview of multiple, related sections of your content. However, be mindful of the number of cards as this might catch the user's attention rather than finishing their task. Ideal number of cards to be placed is around 3.
- If your content includes lengthy information, also consider summarising content of each help panel and add an action button on the last section to link out to a new small window.
- When on the right side of the wizard, it can either scroll with the content in the step, or be fixed to the screen while the user scrolls through the content.

<img src={wizardHelpPanelPlacementRight} className="img-padding" alt="A help panel in the wizard component place on the right side of the content"/>

**Full width** : The help panel can be placed at the top of the wizard below the heading/subtext.
- Use the full width help help panel if your content area exceeds the maximum recommended size of the container. (600px)
- If content includes lengthy information, summarise content and add an action button to link out to a new small window.

<img src={wizardHelpPanelPlacementFullWidth} className="img-padding" alt="A help panel spanning across the full width of the wizard component place"/>

### Anatomy

The help panel is an `expandable card` which provides users with information related to the content on the page. This follows the anatomy of an expandable card with a **recommended max width of 600px**.

The height of the expandable card does not have a max height set. If you would like to add a max height and a scrollbar to the card, you can do so by editing the maxHeight property.

<img src={wizardHelpPanelAnatomy} className="img-padding" alt="Anatomy of wizard help panel"/>

#### 1: Panel
Panels are placed at the right edge of the wizard container. They are a fixed width and typically span the height of the content provided.

Help card panel is an expandable card  which provide users to information related to the content on the page. This follows the anatomy of an expandable card with a **fixed width of 335px**.
<img src={wizardPanelAnatomy} className="img-padding" alt="Anatomy of help panel" width="800" />

##### Standard and Sectioned Panel

**1: Header** - Header of the expandable card and  is control for revealing the content.  Use sentence case.

**2: Prefix Icon** - If you want to use general icons for help, use the `information-alt (!)` icon when some additional explanatory information is available, but not an extensive help system.

Use the `information icon (?)` when content on the panel allows users to perform specific actions or when extensive help is available and that a more sophisticated means of resolving the problem is being offered.

Any icons can be used to give further context as to the what is the content on the panel, but if you are using something different to the information-alt icon, please ensure you've discussed this with your Design Manager.

**3: Expand/collapse icon** - Indicates if the panel is open or closed. By default the chevron icon is placed on the right on the help panel.

Use `arrowPosition` to set the position of the expandable/collapsible arrow, to `right`. This allows for the title on the start side to align with other type elements in the layout.

**4: Content**  - Body of the expandable card associated with the header.

**5: Divider** - Used when there are multiple sections in the panel to separate content. Use the standard divider component

<br />

#### 2: Content
Help panels can display a wide variety of contents and layouts, ranging from a list of definitions, to contents they would allow users to perform specific actions. <br />

##### Standard Content
<img src={wizardPanelContentStandard1} className="img-padding" alt="Standard content anatomy and icon and typography specs" width="540" />
<span className="sui-storybook-image-caption">Standard content shown in text format, with explanatory information having a title in bold and the rest of the explanation in regular font weight.</span>
<br />
<img src={wizardPanelContentStandard2} className="img-padding" alt="Standard content anatomy and spacing specs" width="640" />
<span className="sui-storybook-image-caption">Content shown allows users to perform specific actions /extensive help is available.</span> <br />

##### Sectioned  content
When using sections, ensure content serves the use case, but keep things simple at the same time.

Don't use too much section in one card, distribute extra content to other cards/help panel if you think the context  can be separated.

<img src={wizardPanelContentSectioned1} className="img-padding" alt="A divider is used to separate content on help panel." width="540" />
<span className="sui-storybook-image-caption">A divider is used to separate content. The divider does not span the full width of the card.</span>
<br />
<img src={wizardPanelContentSectioned2} className="img-padding" alt="First section content of the help panel has an action button available." width="540" />
<span className="sui-storybook-image-caption">Option to have actions/input fields on sections are available.</span>

### States

## Specs

### Desktop
**Right Panel** - Help panel has a fixed width of 335px and placed on the right side of content container. The recommended maximum width for the content container is 600px.
<img src={wizardPanelSpecsRight} className="img-padding" alt="Help panel on right side of wizard for desktop view." /><br />

**Full Width** - The recommended width for both card and content container is 600px. If your content exceeds the recommended size, make sure that both card and content are the same width.
<img src={wizardPanelSpecsFull} className="img-padding" alt="Help panel on full width of wizard for desktop view." /><br />

### Tablet
Panel spans full width along with the content container on tablet. The recommended maximum width for the content container is 600px

**Placement**: The Panel is placed at the bottom of the content by default. It can also be placed on top of the content as you see fit.
<img src={wizardPanelSpecsTablet} className="img-padding" alt="Help panel on tablet view." width="600" /><br />

Here are some guidelines for placement for considerations:

**Top**
- If a panel does not repeat in multiple steps and contains important information which helps the user to complete the content below it.
- If it's an important information which helps the user to complete the wizard.

**Bottom**
- If help panel appears on every step - to prevent user from seeing it multiple times.
- If there are more than one card in the help panel.
- If content in a card is too long to be placed on top.

## Behaviour

### States
There are two states for the help panel component: collapsed and expanded.

The status of the help panel is indicated by the chevron icon at the end of the help panel. The down icon indicates a collapsed state and expanded states is indicated by up icon.

By default, help panels are shown in a collapsed form, with all content panels closed. Beginning in a collapsed condition provides the user with a high-level overview of the information provided.

### Panel on multiple steps
If the help panel is on more than one step and the user collapses it and moves to the next step, ensure the panel stays closed until the user opens it again.

### Scrolling
Help panel cannot be horizontally scrolled.

### Sticky
*(optional - desktop)*

The help panel can be fixed in position. When a user scrolls through the content, they will continue to see this section on the right side of the wizard.
