## Input

### Keyboard interaction

| Key | Usage |
| :--- | :--- |
| Tab | Tabbing into a text field selects the existing text. |


### WCAG rules that are applicable
- [1.3.5 Identify Input Purpose AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/identify-input-purpose)
- [1.3.1 Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/info-and-relationships.html)
- [3.3.2 Labels or Instructions A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/labels-or-instructions)
- [2.4.6 Headings and Labels](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/headings-and-labels.html)
- [4.1.2 Name, Role, Value A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/name-role-value)


### Considerations
- Clear and straightforward labelling and instructions should be provided.
- Give instructions on how to fill out the field. Passwords, for example, must have at least 8 characters and/or digits.
- To distinguish between mistakes and alerts, don't rely just on color. Use icons or words that say "Error" or "Alert" instead. -- If both icons and visible text are used to distinguish between mistakes and alerts, the icons are redundant, and screen readers should not be provided with alternate text.
- When an input is focused, labels must be visible.
- On focus, labels must be announced to the screen reader.
