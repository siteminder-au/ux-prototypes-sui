## Usage
Switches enable or disable the status of a specific item. Switches are the recommended method for adjusting on/off settings on mobile devices.

### When to use
- Use this pattern for ON/OFF or ENABLED/DISABLED situations that happen immediately. It makes sense when using this pattern that once the switch is enabled the the effect is immediate and no saving is required.
- If you are designing for mobile, use a toggle regardless of whether the settings are immediate or require review.

### Where to use
- **Forms** - Can be utilized in full-page forms, modals, or side panels.
- **Settings** - Use on settings pages to allow users to toggle between an activated and disabled state for a setting.


## Formatting

### Anatomy

**1: Track -** The track visually displays the states of the switch.

**2: Handle -** The handle is used to display the position along the track. This is moved by the user.

<div className="sui-storybook-highlight"><strong>Label:</strong> Labels should always be present on switches. When the label is not specified, the switch becomes independent. Standalone switches should be utilized only when their link to other components is evident and they provide enough context.</div>

### Placement

The switch is frequently used in forms, it may be added to a full page, a modal, card, dialog or a side panel. A switch may also be used to change settings.

For more information on spacing in forms, etc. , see our [spacing guidance](https://sui-dev-v3-sui-docs.dev.siteminderlabs.com/?path=/story/foundations-spacing-overview--page).

### Orientation
Switches are arranged in vertical orientations so that users may choose to turn on/off  specific items.
<img src={orientation} className="img-padding" alt="Switch with their accompanying labels in vertical orientation." width="540" />


## Internationalisation
The switch arrangement is mirrored in RTL (right-to-left) languages. When the switch is turned on, the track is on the right side of the text and the handle is on the left.
