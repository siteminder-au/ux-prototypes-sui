## Usage
The vertical nav component is one part of the sm-app-header component, which encompasses sm-horizontal-nav, sm-vertical-nav, sm-property-menu and sm-user-menu.

Vertical navigation is used to navigate within primary destinations in our app.

## Formatting

### Anatomy
**1: Group/section header (optional) -** If your nav list has groups or sections, these should be named using a group header. You cannot interact with a group header.

**2: Active list item **- Indicates where a user is within the navigation list.

**3: Default list item -** The default list item state.

**4: Parent list item -** When one list item has further sub-navigation it takes on the parent list item styling. The accordion takes on the default active background state to indicate whether the menu is open or not.

**5: Child list item -** All child list items that fall under a parent take on the child styling. This also includes a selected state as well.

**6: Expand/collapse button -** When the user hovers over the vertical navigation component, the box shadow darkens and takes on our app-primary colour hue as well as having this button appear. Users can click on it if they would like to collapse the vertical navigation for more screen space.

## Specs
### Vertical navigation states
<img src={specsStates1} className="img-padding" alt="Vertical navigation list, heading, parent and child states" />

<img src={specsStates2} className="img-padding" alt="Vertical navigation disabled state, expand and collapsed button states." width="880" />


## Behaviour
### Expanding and collapsing the entire component
<img src={behaviour} className="img-padding" alt="Vertical navigation expand collapse behaviour" />

### Desktop
- When a user hovers over any part of the vertical navigation component, the expand/collapse button will appear and the inner shadow within the component will darken into the app-primary colour.
- When the component is collapsed the expand/collapse button is always visible.

### Large touch screen devices
The navigation will still default to the full desktop version if the app is being viewed on a touch screen larger than 1260px wide. In this case, the app will detect that a touch screen device is being used and the expand/collapse button will always be visible.

### Motion
- The slide transition of the expand and collapse motion is `0.3s` with a linear transition.
- All over hover effects are instant.
