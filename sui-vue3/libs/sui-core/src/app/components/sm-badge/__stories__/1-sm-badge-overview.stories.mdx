<SuiStorybookTitle>
  <h1>Badge</h1>
  <p>
    A badge, generally appearing either inside or in close proximity to another larger component, is a visual indicator for numerical values such as tallies
    and scores. It is used to notify users of action that has to be done or the status of an item.
    <br/><br/>
    Badges assist in drawing attention to vital information, such as alerts or new and unread messages. They are typically used to provide secondary or
    supplementary information to text.

## Usage
- Use badges to keep track of numerical values for crucial information near the relevant object.
- A badge informs the user that something new or updated has occurred without displaying a count, such as messages or activity notifications. Even when the count is known, it may be helpful as a less visible symbol.
- Use badges to alert users to changes in values or status.

**If you need a text or status label, use sm-tag instead**


## Anatomy

**1: Badge Container** - Primary element, color-coded to indicate statuses.

**2: Counter (optional)** - Counter indicator describing the badge

<img src={anatomy} alt="Anatomy" width="336px" />


## Types

### Dot badge

The dot badge is used to indicate that something has changed without providing a count, letting the user know that there is an update.
Use the size props “small” for this type of badge.

<img src={typesDot1} alt="Dot badge" width="168px" />

**Guideline:**

- Use the red badge for urgent/important items
- Use the green badge for new/added items
- Use the blue badge for unread/non-urgent items
- Dot badge is removed after the user accesses and views the feature

**Best practice:**

Tooltips should be included on badges as needed, to improve user understanding. A badge, for example, that is used in combination with a disabled button, may need further explanation.

<img src={typesDot2} alt="Dot badge best practice" />


### Number badge

The number badge is used for the platform's countable features. Use badges in combination with another item or component or label to eliminate uncertainty about which object is being measured.

<img src={typesNumber1} alt="Number badge" width="168px" />

**Guideline:**

1. If using a medium badge with an icon, please only use with icons 24px and larger.
2. A number or a number with text like "10x" as a multiplier can be used as the badge content. Badge content can only have a **maximum of 3 characters**.
3. Number badges can only have **2 digits**. The label changes to "99+" when you reach 100 or or higher.

**Best practice:**

- Use badges to keep track of crucial information near the relevant items.
- Use badges to draw attention of users to changes in values with relevant items.

<img src={typesNumber2} alt="Number badge best practice" />

### “New” badge

The new badge can be used when a new feature or service is released. This is applied only during the first release.

<img src={typesNew1} alt="New badge" width="84px" />

Guideline:

If a new feature is released on the platform, the new badge can be used at first and is either changed into a dot, number badge or removed afterwards after the user accesses the new item/feature.

**Best practice:**

- Use badges to keep track of crucial information near the relevant items.
- Use badges to draw attention of users to relevant items.

****Sample use of new badge**

<img src={typesNew2} alt="New badge best practice" />


## Sizing

### Small

If using a small badge with an icon, use with icons 24px or lower

**Badge size:**
- Height: 12px
- Width: 12px

<img src={sizeSmall} alt="Small badge" width="168px" />

### Medium

If using a medium badge with an icon, use with icons 24px and larger. Designer discretion to use medium size or large size with information near the relevant items.

**Badge size:**
- Height: 20px
- Min Width: 20px

<img src={sizeMedium} alt="Medium badge" width="168px" />

### Large

Use of large badges should remain fairly flexible.

**Badge size:**
- Height: 24px
- Min Width: 24px

<img src={sizeLarge} alt="Large badge" width="504px" />


## Placement

### Default

The default placement for badges is in the top-right corner.

<img src={placementDefault} alt="Default placement" width="420px" />

### Optional

Other optional placement for the badge is center aligned with the components or text labels.

<img src={placementOptional} alt="Optional placement" width="420px" />


## Behaviours

### When to show the badge

#### When showing the badge as notifications

For badges used to notify users that there are new items available, or when new notifications have arrived,  badges are shown automatically.

<img src={behavior1} alt="Badge as notifications" />

#### When showing the badge as indicators

When there is an item to be updated, badges are shown instantly after a user performs an action.

<img src={behavior2} alt="Badge as indicators" />

#### When showing the badge as counters to relevant items

When used to keep track of crucial information near the relevant items, badges are always shown.

<img src={behavior3} alt="Badge as counters" width="336px" />

#### When showing the badge as “New” badges

- For existing users, the “New” badge can appear for a certain number of days ( product discretion)
- For new users, no “New” badge should appear as for these users everything is new.

<img src={behavior4} alt="New badges" width="420px" />

### When to remove the badge

#### As notifications and indicators

The badge disappears as soon as the user uses or checks the new item or feature.

#### “New” badges

Still, product discretion on how many days before a badge disappears.


## Variants

### Default/Dark

For the dark variant, these use the default utility colors:

- $app-success
- $app-warning
- $app-alert
- $app-info
- $grey-neu-light

<img src={variantsDefault} alt="Dark variants" width="252px" />

### Light

The default variant (dark) should be used in most cases. Only use the light variant if the badge is appearing on a background color which isn't appropriate (i.e., dark blue badge in the app-header).

For the light variant, these uses the light utility colors:

- $app-success-light
- $app-warning-light
- $app-alert-light
- $app-info-light
- $grey-neu-light

<img src={variantsLight} alt="Light variants" width="252px" />
