  <h1>Badge</h1>
  <p>
    A badge, generally appearing either inside or in close proximity to another larger component, is a visual indicator for numerical values such as tallies
    and scores. It is used to notify users of action that has to be done or the status of an item.
    <br/><br/>
    Badges assist in drawing attention to vital information, such as alerts or new and unread messages. They are typically used to provide secondary or
    supplementary information to text.

## Accessibility

Badges are only interpreted by assistive technology, such as screen readers, based simply on their content. They could leave the user confused if context is not provided.

For **product teams**, set the badge's or parent elements **aria-label attribute** to provide context for users of screen readers.

_For example, the badge should read "40 unread emails" instead of just "40"_
