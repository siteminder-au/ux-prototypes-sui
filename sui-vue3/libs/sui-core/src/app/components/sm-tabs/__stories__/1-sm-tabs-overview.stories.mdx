## Usage
Tabs are used to organise different but related content. This allows users to navigate and view this content without having to ever move away from the page.

Tabs can be used in the main page content area or inside other larger components such as cards or side panels.

### When to use
Use tabs when you would like to organise large amounts of related content into different categories, which may help reduce cognitive load and allow a user to complete their tasks without having to navigate away from the page that they are on.

## Formatting

### Anatomy
**1: Tab label -** The label is in small section header type styling. Please ensure the label clearly describes the content of the tab, but also remains short in length.

**2: Prefix and suffix icons -** Icons can be placed as either prefix or suffix adjacent to the label. They are `16x16 px`.

**3: Active tab indicator -** To indicate that a tab is `active`, a `2px bottom border `in the primary colour will appear, along with a change in text colour, also to the primary.

**4: Baseline -** By default this line should span the page, however when used inside other components the line can be switched off.

## Variants and properties

### Standard
This is the standard tab format. See below for the different state styling.
<img src={variantStandard} className="img-padding" alt="Standard variant tabs."/>

### With icons
This is the standard tab format with use of icons. These are easily added into the tab labels by engineers via the prefix and suffix icon properties.
<img src={variantIcons} className="img-padding" alt="Tabs variant with icons."/>

### Desktop version only
For instances where you don't want to use the default tablet version of tabs the desktop version will persist through all breakpoints. A small scrollbar will appear below the tabs allowing the user to scroll horizontally.

## Behaviour

### Tablet and mobile breakpoints
The default version of the tab component on tablet and mobile can be seen below.

- Tabs will condense into a select/dropdown style component.
- Clicking on the dropdown will push the content down.
- The user can select any tab and the content area will update accordingly.
