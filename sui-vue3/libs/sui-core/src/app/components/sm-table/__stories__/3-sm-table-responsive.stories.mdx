## Responsive Tables

For enhanced reading on small displays, a responsive table is available at narrow widths.

There isn't a one-size-fits-all solution for responsive data tables. The underlying data of the table, as well as the task that a user is attempting to achieve
when utilizing the table, must always guide your approach. We can use two general approaches when designing responsive data tables:
- Horizontal Scroll
- Stacking Rows

You may also try to reduce the amount of content a user must navigate on a smaller screen by considering hiding less important columns.


## Horizontal Scroll

### Usage

When using a table for comparison, it is important to maintain a standard row and column-based structure. This approach can scale to handle multiple columns as
needed by allowing the user to scroll horizontally through columns.

The scroll approach:
- Allows for quick data comparison over several rows.
- Maintains the usual tabular view that consumers are accustomed to in desktop.
- Gives consistent experience. (sorting, row selection, and table operations features are consistent with large screen experiences.)

### Considerations

- Use the fixed column header variant for this approach on mobile.When a user scrolls horizontally over columns, locking the first column in place and allowing
the table's data to scroll behind it gives a constant frame of reference.

- Use an overflow for this approach on the table's scrollable section to provide the user affordance on the scrollability of the table.
When scrolling reaches the end of the table - the gradient on that side should be hidden to indicate there is no more content in that direction.

- If content is taller than the viewport, use a fixed row header so that users know which columns they are seeing.

## Stack

### Usage

You can make structural adjustments to eliminate horizontal scrolling when a table provides a group of unique elements—for example, customer contact information.

The stack approach stacks all of the cells in a row vertically with their labels and generally wraps them in a container.

Be mindful of stacking when there are multiple column on your table. If stacking would cover most of your viewport, consider using the scroll approach.

The stack approach:
- Removes horizontal scrolling.
- Provides a logical grouping for a set of linked data.
- Improves touch target sizes and adapts design to cater for smaller displays with more flexibility.

## Specs

### Width

Tables must be in full width of the screen size with 16px padding on both sides of the screen.

### Target area
The minimum touch target for medium/standard table for interactive elements is 48 x 48px. Adjust accordingly in xsmall-small size tables.

### Table cell padding, icons and font sizes
Table cell padding depends on the size of the table cells/headers. This is minimized to improve content density.
