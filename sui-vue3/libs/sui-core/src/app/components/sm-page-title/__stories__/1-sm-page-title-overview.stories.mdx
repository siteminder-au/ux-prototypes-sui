## Usage
To ensure our users can orientate themselves at all times while navigating our Platform, we use the page title component to visually label and introduce each page.

The primary action and contextual menu for each page is also housed within this component.

## Formatting
### Anatomy
**1: Title**  - The title text for the page title is mandatory. This is styled in H1.

**2: Subtitle (optional)** - The subtitle is optional and styled in H1 **$app-dark/$blue-neu-dark.** Use this if you would like to inform the user of how many items exist on the page.

**3: Primary action (optional)** - If you are using sm-page-title on a page with a primary action, then turn this on. Most creation wizards are triggered with this button. There should only be one primary action per page.

**4: Secondary action (optional)** - If your page has more than a primary action, then consolidate the other actions using this context menu, which uses secondary icon button styling.

### Placement
The page title is always placed at the top of the page.
<img src={placement} alt="Page title H1 placement" />

### Sizing
The page title will stay consistent on desktop and tablet breakpoints and some items will truncate on mobile breakpoints.

The mobile breakpoint is not live yet on the app.

## Variants
### Default page title
The default page title consists of the title and the subtitle. The subtitle is optional.

<img src={variantsDesktop} alt="Default page title on desktop" />


### Page title with actions
You may also add primary and secondary actions to your page title. Your primary action should only appear once on a page. On mobile, due to space constraints, the primary and secondary actions truncate into the context-menu and it takes on primary styling.
