## Usage

  ### What is a dropdown?
  The dropdown component is a menu type that offers a compact list of actions for the user to choose from.

  It is common to have a list of items to select within a dropdown that affect the content on the current page, i.e. adding additional translation text area inputs or an item from a list of items. These actions generally do not result in a new page load.

  ### What is a Menu?
  Menus appear on top of the action/button. It is common to have a list of actions to select within a menu that changes the page, i.e. selecting settings and going to an entirely new page or selecting edit and a drawer opening up. These actions generally result in a new page load or taking the user to a new experience (like the drawer).

  ### Considerations
  The dropdown component nests **sm-vertical-nav-item** within its structure, this the main element used in out vertical navigation and is reused here.

## Formatting

  ### Dropdown anatomy
  **1: List item** - Default state of the list item.

  **2: Prefix icon (optional)** - Optional prefix icon appears before the text of the list item. Do not use icons unless all the list items are using icons, they should not only appear on one item. Icons can be used with the default dropdown, but is not commonly used.

  **3: Selected item** - When an item is selected, this will be visible by the blue line and highlight within the container of the list item. The list item text will also appear bold.

  <img src={anatomyDd} alt="Dropdown anatomy" width="259" />

  ### Menu anatomy
  **1: List item** - Default state of the list item.

  **2: Prefix icon (optional)** - This is optional, however very widely used in the menu variant across our products. The icons give further context as to the type of action the user will be taking, as many of these actions are more critical than the actions contained in a default dropdown.

  **3: Selected item** - When an item is selected, this will be visible by the blue line and highlight within the container of the list item. The list item text will also appear bold.

  **4: Menu heading** - The heading of the menu. This required as a lot of our menu’s are triggered with icon buttons and no other description of the menu besides the chosen icon. The heading should be logical and descriptive. It is accompanied by a close icon to allow the user an additional way to close the menu.

  <img src={anatomyMenu} alt="Menu anatomy" width="259" />

  ### Dropdown placement
  The Dropdown component will appear below the triggering action (such as a button) by default. If there is no space below the triggering element the dropdown will appear above, right or left of the action.

  ### Menu placement
  The menu variant will appear on top of the triggering action (such as a button) by default.

  <img src={placement} alt="Menu and dropdown placement" width="968" />


## Variants

  ### Dropdown
  It is common to have a list of items to select within a dropdown that affect the content on the current page, i.e. adding additional translation text area inputs or an item from a list of items. These actions generally do not result in a new page load.

  ### Menu
  Menus appear on top of the action/button. It is common to have a list of items to select within a menu that changes the page, i.e. selecting settings and going to an entirely new page or selecting edit and a drawer opening up. These actions generally result in a new page load or taking the user to a new experience (like the drawer).


## Behaviour
  ### Triggering the dropdown
  The dropdown menu may be triggered by clicking on the triggering action (such as a button). The dropdown can be closed by clicking on the trigger again or anywhere outside of the dropdown.

  ### sm-dropdown: With suffix icon and sub-menu
  If you require a suffix icon on an item then it will appear and behave as outlined below.

  <img src={icons} alt="Icon placement within the dropdown" width="555" />



## Specs
  ### List items
  List items are 48px high. You may add descriptive text and truncation to the list items.
  <img src={list} alt="Dropdown list items" width="627" />

  ### Menu list items
  The menu variant also comes with a header, as seen in the image below.
  <img src={menuList} alt="Menu list items" width="325" />
