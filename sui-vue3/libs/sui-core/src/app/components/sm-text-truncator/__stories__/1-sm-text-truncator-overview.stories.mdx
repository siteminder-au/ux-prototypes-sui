## Usage

### What is the text truncator?
This component will expand and collapse lines of text within a paragraph element. This will help manage overflow of text that exceeds your ideal container height.

### How does it work?
The text truncator only works on lines of text. **If you want to truncate dynamic content or need a more flexible truncator, please use the [HTML truncator](https://sui-dev-v3-sui-docs.dev.siteminderlabs.com/?path=/story/components-html-truncator-overview--page).

You can set the number of text/paragraph lines you'd like to be visible on load. Clicking on the 'Read more' button will expand the truncator to reveal all the content. The final line will end in an ellipsis.

### When to use
You should use this component if:

- You have limited space and need to communicate information to the user. Ensure the visible lines contain the most important information.
- Internationalisation or translating into certain languages is causing an issue with how pages are displaying (i.e. the UI might break once translation occurs do to space). This can be used on paragraphs to ensure the number of lines of text don't exceed a certain amount, as long as it's appropriate to have the 'Read more' button below.


## Formatting

### Anatomy
**1: Text based content -** This is the content that displays within `sm-text-truncator`. It can only be text based. An ellipsis will appear to truncate the overflow of text at the end of the last line.

**2: Expand/collapse button -** This button will expand and collapse the text.

**3: `clampLine` property -** This will accept a numerical value and controls the amount of lines that will load. The default is 2. If your content does not exceed the clampLine set (i.e. clampLine is set to 3, but you only have 2 lines of text) then the button and ellipsis will not be visible.
