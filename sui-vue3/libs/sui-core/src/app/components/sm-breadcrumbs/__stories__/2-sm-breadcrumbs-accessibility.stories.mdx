  <h1>Breadcrumbs</h1>
  <p>
    Breadcrumbs are a form of secondary navigation that allows users to understand their location in our app, the hierarchy of levels, and to quickly navigate back through them.

## Keyboard interaction
No special keyboard interaction is required. Tab through the breadcrumb structure as you would any other part of a page.

## Features
### Directly from WGAC:
- The set of links is structured using an ordered list .
- A `nav` element labeled Breadcrumb identifies the structure as a breadcrumb trail and makes it a navigation landmark so that it is easy to locate.
- To prevent screen reader announcement of the visual separators between links, they are added via CSS:

  - The separators are part of the visual presentation that signifies the breadcrumb trail, which is already semantically represented by the `nav` element with its label of Breadcrumb. So, using a display technique that is not represented in the accessibility tree used by screen readers prevents redundant and potentially distracting verbosity.
  - Each link has a border on one side that is skewed with the CSS' `transform` property so it resembles a slash.
