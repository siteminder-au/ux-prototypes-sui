  <h1>Card</h1>
  <p>
    Cards are a great way to group content, media and actions. You can use cards to organise static content in a way that makes them easily scannable or
    editable content, which helps to organize information that can be modified by the user.

## Usage
1. Use a card to display information and interactions on a particular topic.Relevant and actionable content should be easy to identify on cards. Text and graphics should be arranged on cards in a structure that is understandable.
2. Cards can be used to go to greater levels of detail or as an entry point.
3. Cards are ideal for keeping a diverse set of items (i.e., not all of the information is of the same basic kind) - cards are a good choice for dashboard applications as well as social or aggregation sites that display multiple content types on the same page.
4. Cards can be shown in a grid, vertical list, or carousel.


## Anatomy

### Basic Card
**1: Container** - Container size is defined by the amount of space those elements take up. The container expresses card elevation.

**2: Headline** - The subject of the card, such as the name of a picture album or an article, is frequently communicated through the headline text.

**3: Supporting text** - Body material, such as an article summary or a description, is an example of supporting text.

**4: Buttons** - Cards can have action buttons such as Learn more, Save and/or Cancel.

**5: Icon buttons (optional)** - Cards can feature action buttons such as Edit or Like or an overflow menu.

### Media Card
**1: Container** - Container size is defined by the amount of space those elements take up. The container expresses card elevation.

**2: Headline** - The subject of the card, such as the name of a picture album or an article, is frequently communicated through the headline text.

**3: Supporting text** - Body material, such as an article summary or a description, is an example of supporting text.

**4: Image (optional)** - Photos, illustrations, and other visuals, such as icons, can be used in cards.

**5: Buttons** - Cards can have action buttons such as Learn more, Save and/or Cancel.

**6: Icon buttons (optional)** - Cards can feature action buttons such as Edit or Like or an overflow menu.

## Content Style Types
Cards have  five content styles: basic, media, editable, custom and notification, with the default being the basic card. Content styles are designed to be used independently and should not be combined or utilized in a layout.

### Basic Card
The basic card has the the following customisations: header text, body text, action, and an edit/selector action in the top right.

<img src={basicCardStyles} alt="Basic card styles" width="846" />

### Media Card

<img src={mediaCardStyles} alt="Media card styles" width="504" />

### Editable Card
An editable card is designed to support a form within it. When the card's in editing mode, the background, top border and box shadow of the card will change to highlight it against other cards.

<img src={editableCardStyles} alt="Editable card styles" width="846" />

### Custom Card
Very similar to the basic card, but with the addition of an icon and tag placement. All actions, spacings, paddings, margins still apply.

<img src={customCardStyles} alt="Custom card styles" width="588" />

### Notification Card
To be used in the Notifications Centre. These borrow from the card styles above; please see the corresponding storybook components in brackets.

<img src={notificationCardStyles} alt="Notification card styles" width="756" />

## Appearance

### Elevation
Elevation helps to distinguish the cards from the background and may be used to show when a card is clickable.

By default, the card component does not use an elevation, whereas **shadow-lg** is used on hover to signal that a card is **clickable**.

<img src={elevation} alt="Elevation" width="588" />

### Border
Card containers have **1px border** with **color: $blue-neu-mid**.
Also, by default, cards have a **2px top border** with **color: $blue-neu-dark**. On hover, this color changes to **$app-info**.

<img src={border} alt="Border" width="588" />


## Scaling and Adaptation

Adjust the visual presentation of a card when scaling layouts for smaller displays by specifying minimum and maximum values for margins, padding, and container dimensions.

Follow the guidelines for paddings and spacings in the [breakpoints documentation](https://zeroheight.com/96e64b7be/v/0/p/629ea7-breakpoints).

<img src={desktop} alt="Desktop" width="846" />

<img src={tablet} alt="Tablet" width="504" />

Cards should be kept at least 32px away from the screen's leading and trailing edges. On tiny displays, cards scale vertically.

## Behaviours

### Clickable cards
Cards are interactive in some way, such as viewing, editing, saving, and so on. Some actions are triggered via buttons, while others are triggered by just clicking the card.

You may choose not to include a button if a card can be opened or seen in more detail, which can be performed by clicking anywhere on the card.

<img src={clickable} alt="Clickable cards" width="420" />

If there are other components such as icon buttons, but no primary buttons in the card, the whole card (excluding those components) should be clickable. Also provide the documented hover states on the other components.

Always show the card hover state. Set the **interactive props** to **true**.

<img src={hoverable} alt="Interactive cards" width="846" />

### Actions in cards
If a card has actions / buttons, display the stated hover states for that component.

<img src={actions} alt="Card actions" width="846" />

### Non-interactive card
When the card is in a non-interactive mode, the background, top border and box shadow of the card won't change in order to highlight the card. Only the actions in the card are provided with documented feedbacks/states.
