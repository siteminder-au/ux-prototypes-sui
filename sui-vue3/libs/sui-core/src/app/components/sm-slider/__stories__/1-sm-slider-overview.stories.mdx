## Usage

The slider is a component that allows users view and select values or range of values using a very visual format. Users can make these selections by moving the handle/s along the slider track.

Generally any values changed via the slider should be seen immediately by the user. If you are using the slider where information must be saved first to take effect (such as advanced filters) please first check in with a SUI designer or your Design Manager first.

## Formatting
  ### Anatomy
  **1: Handle** - The handle is used to display the position and value along the track. This is moved by the user.

  **2: Track** - The track visually displays the total value range of the slider.

  **3: Prefix and suffix (optional)** - Optional prefix and suffix slots, are available to enable to the user to more accurately control the slider if they wish. You can add either icons or input fields into these slots.

  **4: Value tooltip (optional)** - The value tooltip is optional, and displays the exact value of the location of the handle. This follows the handle as the user adjusts the settings.

  **5: Check points (optional)** - Check points are available to apply to the track to help the user move to predetermined values along the track. The handle 'snaps' to these locations.

  **5: Slider label (optional)** - The slider label is an optional feature that may be added to help the user understand what the slider controls.
  <img src={anatomy} alt="Slider anatomy" width="676" />

  ### Placement
  Placement of this component is largely based on the overall vertical rhythm of your page. Please ensure you have considered space for the tooltip if you are using this optional feature. Ensure you are using the 8pt grid and that spacing above and below adheres to this principle.

  ### Sizing
  The default size of this component in Figma is 272 wide, however you will need to set your ideal width depending on where you are using this component the overall sizing of your other components (such as form fields, etc). Please feel free to adjust the size as you please however, ensure that it is consistent with the overall aesthetics and rhythm of your page design.


## Variants

  ### Default
  The default slider features the track and handle with the optional value tooltip and slider label on by default. These may be turned off if necessary.
  <img src={variantDefault} alt="Default slider" width="216" />

  ### Slider with prefix and suffix
  Input fields or Icons may be added as prefix, suffix or both (in the case of a slider with range). This allows the user to input more precise values, but will make the component more larger and visually clunkier.
  <img src={variantPrefix} alt="Slider with prefix and suffix" width="331" />

  ### Slider with checkpoints
  You may add checkpoints to your slider that the handle will 'snap' to, when dragged near.
  <img src={variantCheckpoint} alt="Slider with checkpoints" width="216" />

  ### Slider with range
  The slider also supports a value range, which could be useful for filtering data by a specific range.
  <img src={variantRange} alt="Slider with value ranges" width="216" />


## Behaviour

  ### Handle
  The handle increases in size while hovering on desktop and while pressing on touch devices. While pressing, the handle fills in a solid primary/warning/success colour which is instant.

## Restrictions

  The slider should only be used to select numerical values only. If you would like to use the slider for something other representing numerical values, please consider another selection control component such as grouped checkbox buttons.

  <table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Do's</th>
      <th>Don'ts</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        ✅ Use the slider to enable users to input values such as volume, hours, durations or rate ranges. These values are generally either not exceedingly large or not necessarily required to be precise.
        <br/><br/>
        <img src={restrictionsDo} alt="Slider do's" />
      </td>
      <td>
        ❌ Don't use the slider for inputting non-numerical values such as day ranges.
        <br/><br/>
        <img src={dont} alt="Slider don'ts" />
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

**Please use the slider only when selections do not need to be precise. To comfortably use this component users will need to have good motor skills.** The slider is not recommended if precise value input is required from the user. If you would like to use the slider as well as allowing the user to input values precisely, then please also use the slider with inputs, which is an optional feature.
