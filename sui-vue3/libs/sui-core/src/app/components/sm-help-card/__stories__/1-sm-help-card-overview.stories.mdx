## Usage
Use help cards to inform the user of important status changes, persistent conditions and system updates. Help cards generally fall under two categories, task and system initiated communication.

### Task initiated usage
This type of usage is initiated in response to user action during a specific task. They give users direct, immediate feedback. They should be placed in the region of the page the user is working in and be related to the user’s action.

**Examples of task initiated usage:**
- Explaining why an interaction or information is not available on a page.
- Explaining what steps need to be completed first before an interaction becomes available on a page.
- Adding in important contextual information during a task.

### System initiated usage
This type of usage is initiated by the application or system, independent of user action. They provide updates on background system status or out-of-context events that have finished.

**Examples of system initiated usage:**
- Informing the user when they are behind a paywall.
- Alerting the user if a login session is about to expire.

<div className="sui-storybook-highlight sui-storybook-highlight--warning"><strong>When not to use a Help card</strong><br />When highly critical information needs to be communicated to a user, please use the Banner component instead. An example of this might be if the user cannot be paid due to a financial/payment issue or their account subscription is due to run out. A banner has more urgency and can persist through several pages if required. </div>

## Formatting

### Anatomy
**1: Icon type** - This (along with the colour) indicates what the help cards type is. The types can be Info, Warning, Success and Alert.

**2: Title** -This can either serve as the title of the card or the entire contents of the card, depending on what message is being conveyed.

**3: Body text (optional)** - This text is optional. If you don't require it, then the content of the message will appear in the title text.

### Sizing
The height of the card will adjust depending on how many lines of text are within. The width of the card should always span the width of the page or container.

### Placement
You should place these cards in the appropriate context:

- Banners relevant to an entire page should be placed at the top of that page, below the page header. They should occupy the full width of the container.
- Banners related to a section of a page (like a card, popover, or modal) should be placed inside that section, below any section heading. These banners have less spacing and a pared-back design to fit within a content context.
- Banners related to an element more specific that a section should be placed immediately above or below that element.
