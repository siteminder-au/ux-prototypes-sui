  <h1>Pagination</h1>
  <p>
    Pagination allows users to split large amounts of data over several pages, with access to controls to help navigate through the data. Pagination is a great pattern to use when the user is searching for something particular, rather than scanning.
    <br /><br />
    Users have a sense of control over their content and this pattern allows them to take a mental note of where things are in the order of data.
