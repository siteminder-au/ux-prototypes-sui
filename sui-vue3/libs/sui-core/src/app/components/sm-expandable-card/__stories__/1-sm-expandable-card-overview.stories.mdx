## Usage
Expandable cards are designed to support expandable/collapsible cards layout with custom header, body and add a new card button at footer.

They function almost in the same way as accordions. By using progressive disclosure, large amounts of information can fit into a card. The header title provides a high-level summary of the information and allows the user to choose which parts to read.

### When to use
- To group together related information.
- When it is not necessary to view material in its entirety, simplify cards and decrease scrolling.

## Formatting

### Anatomy
**1: Container**  - Container size is defined by the amount of space those elements take up. The container expresses card elevation.

**2: Header section (optional)** - This is a custom content area which can be static or interactive (i.e. input text fields).

**3: Body** - Body is the actual expandable area.

**4: Footer (optional)** - Footer can be used for custom content. An example is a CTA which can be used to add another body section.

**5: Icon button** - Indicates if the card is open or closed.Standard placement is to the left. However, if used inside another container such as a drawer or modal, it can be placed on the right.

**6: Divider (optional)** - Used to separate body sections. Can be turned off when using the component inside another area like a drawer or a dialog box.

### Sizing
There is no default width size for the expandable cards.
<div className="sui-storybook-highlight">It is very important that you indicate what the ideal width is in your designs and communicate this clearly to engineering.</div>

### Placement
Expandable cards are used in the dashboard for the channel status feature. This can also be used on other pages -- just remember that your placement should be relevant to the page and serve its use.

### Borders

## Variants
Use the variant which you think would suit best for your use cases/scenarios.

### Standard
This is the default state of the expandable card.

- An `sm-expandable-card` component is designed to support expandable/collapsible cards layout with custom header, body and add a new card button at footer.
- Use the `header slot` to provide a custom static header.
- Use the `default slot` to define custom content for the card.
- Use the `footer slot` to provide a custom button or other clickable element to add expandable card `sm-expandable-card-body` using body slot.
- Use the `body slot` to provide custom expandable card body `sm-expandable-card-body`.


The **`sm-expandable-card-body`** component has an overflow property that will display scrollbar if height exceeds then given max-height.

Use **`contentClass`** props to apply any custom class to the wrapper.

Add **`sm-overflow-visible`** class to **`contentClass`** props to set overflow **`unset`** on card expand if the child component has tendency to overflow.

### Without fixed header
It is possible to remove the header section and only place the footer by default.

### Expandable card - body
The body section of the card is inside the container itself.

An **`sm-expandable-card-body`** component is designed to support expandable/collapsible cards with custom header and body.
- Use the `header slot` to provide a custom button or other clickable element to expandable/collapsible the card.
- Use the `body slot` to provide a custom expandable card body.

<img src={variantCardBody} alt="Expandable cards with body section" width="560" />


### Nested expandable card
This is a combination of nested expandable cards.

An **`sm-expandable-card-body`** component is designed to support expandable/collapsible cards with custom header and body.

- Use the `header slot` to provide a custom button or other clickable element to expandable/collapsible the card.
- Use the `body slot` to provide a custom expandable card body
- Use the `arrowPosition` props set to right when `sm-expandable-card` component does not have default delete button on nested `sm-expandable-card-body` component.

### Expandable card type two
Similar to an accordion, this variant has expandable/collapsible row with custom content inside a card container. An sm-expandable-card component is designed to support expandable/collapsible cards layout.

- Use the `default slot` to define custom content for the card.
- Use `sm-expandable-card-bod`y component to support expandable/collapsible cards with custom header and body.
- Best Practices, Whenever there are multiple slots, use the `full template based syntax` for all slots including `default`.

### Help panel
Help panel are used in the wizard.

For more information on how to use, refer to [Help pattern documentation](https://sui-dev-v3-sui-docs.dev.siteminderlabs.com/?path=/story/design-patterns-help-wizard-help-panel--page#usage").

- Use `isHelpCard` props to apply help card styling to the `sm-expandable-card-body` component.
- Apply custom styling to `sm-expandable-card-body` component body `slot`.

## Behaviour
### States
The expandable card has two states: collapsed and expanded.

Expandable cards by default begin with a collapsed state with all content closed. This gives the user a high-level summary of the available data.

Arrow icon indicates which state the card is in. Arrow down in a collapsed state and arrow up in an expanded state.

### Interaction
Users can change the card states by clicking on the arrow or any where in the area.
