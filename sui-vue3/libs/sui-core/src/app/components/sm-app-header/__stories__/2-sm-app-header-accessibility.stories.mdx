## Skip links
Skip links are internal page links that aid navigation around a page. They are detected by screen readers and help users quickly jump to and over content on the page.

Skip links are added between the opening of the body tag and the page header.

Some examples of how skip links can be worded:
- Skip navigation
- Skip main navigation
- Skip navigation links
- Skip to main content
- Skip to content

<img src={skipLink} className="img-padding" alt="Skip links are added between the opening of the body tag and the page header." />

## Keyboard interaction

| Key | Usage |
| :--- | :--- |
| Space <br />Enter | Opens menu item. If item has sub-menu, then focus moves to the first item in the sub-menu list. |
| Down arrow (not yet live) | If focused on a nav item with sub-menu, opens the sub-menu and moves focus to the first item in the list. |
| Up Arrow (not yet live) | If focused on a nav item with sub-menu, opens the sub-menu and moves focus to the last item in the list. |
| Tab | Moves focus to the next item in the app-header. |
| Shift + Tab | This key combination provides the same behavior as the Tab key, but in the reverse order. |

## Tab order
1. When a user hits tab, they will first cycle through all available skip links
2. Logomark/Dashboard
3. Smart Guide page
4. Property switcher
5. Help page
6. Notifications menu
7. Account menu
8. Horizontal-nav links from left to right
9. Vertical-nav links from top to bottom
10. Expand/collapse button (when focussing, button takes on focus state and is always visible)

<img src={tabOrder} className="img-padding" alt="App header tab order." />
