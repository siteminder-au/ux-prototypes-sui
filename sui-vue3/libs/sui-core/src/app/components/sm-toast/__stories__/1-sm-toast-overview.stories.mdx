## Usage

  ### When should I use a toast?
  You should use this component if:

  - You'd like to give users confirmation of updates or changes they have made to their data. Communicating with users and providing immediate feedback are important for building trust.
  - Please ensure your messages are relevant, timely and informative.

## Formatting

  ### Anatomy
  **1: Title (Optional, off by default)** - If you need a more prominent toast, you may use the title option which is styled with a H5. Please do not put your message into this section.

  **2: Message -** This is where the message must be entered. Please ensure it is relevant, informative and consistent with the rest of the platform.

  **3: Action (optional, off by default) -** You may use actions in the form of text anchors. These are not buttons.

  **4: Close icon button (Optional, on by default)** - The showClose property is optional, either set it to true or false. It is on by default.

  **5: Icon - **The icon will always appear unless you are using the Mini toast variant in which case it will be removed.

  ### Placement
  By default, the toast will appear in the **top** location. See below for a location of where you can set a toast to appear in.

## Specs

## Variants

  ### Standard toast
  These are standard toasts. These are the default toast style, and should be used in the majority of most cases.
  <img src={variantStandard} className="img-padding" alt="Standard toast variant" width="960"/>

  ### Mini toast
  Mini toasts do not have any iconography and should only be used basic confirmation of actions, where a regular toast might be too intrusive and heavy. **Warning toasts for instance would be better served using a standard toast (above) as the iconography is an extra visual aid, incase the user is colour blind**.

  Actions in mini toasts are inline with the text and need to be manually put in using our primary colour.
  <img src={variantMini} className="img-padding" alt="Mini toast variant" width="960"/>

  ### Standard with Action
  The action in toasts are not buttons, but rather text anchors or links.
  <img src={variantStandardWithAction} className="img-padding" alt="Standard with action toast variant" width="960"/>

  ### Standard with Title
  Only use titles when your toast needs more prominence. Never put the message in the title area.
  <img src={variantStandardWithTitle} className="img-padding" alt="Standard with title toast variant" width="960"/>

## Types

  ### Default
  The default toast is our most widely used type. Use this in most cases where the users action needs to be confirmed.
  <img src={typeDefault} className="img-padding" alt="Default toast" width="960"/>

  ### Warning
  Use warning toasts when something has gone wrong, when user access has been denied or when an action could not be completed. This colour reinforce the severity of the message.
  <img src={typeWarning} className="img-padding" alt="Warning toast" width="960"/>

  ### Success
  These are used to provide positive confirmations of a successful user action.
  <img src={typeSuccess} className="img-padding" alt="Success toast" width="960"/>

  ### Alert
  Use this toast to help the user avoid a warning or error situation. Communicate the types of potential warning situations so that the user can avoid them. A recommended action should be provided to the user, along with an action if applicable.
  <img src={typeAlert} className="img-padding" alt="Alert toast" width="960"/>

## Behaviour

  ### Closing or dismissing a toast
  By default, toasts will not be dismissible, so please set the prop `showClose` to `True` if you'd like the user to manually dismiss the toast.

  If you would like your toast to automatically close after a certain amount of time, then set `isTimeout` to `True`. By default, when the timeout option is set, the default timeout is 5 seconds, however you can change this depending on how much copy is within the toast message.

  ### Animation
  The toast eases in with a 0.3ms slide animation.
  <img src={behaviorAnimation} className="img-padding" alt="Toast animation ease in" width="960"/>
