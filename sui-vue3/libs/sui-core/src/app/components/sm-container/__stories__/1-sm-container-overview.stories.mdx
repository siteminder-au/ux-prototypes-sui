## Usage
The container component is used on every page as it contains our page padding and spacing specifications. Usage of this component helps ensure our spacing is consistent across the entire platform on all breakpoints.

## Formatting
### Anatomy
**1: Full container** - This is the container in full, including the padding.

**2: Content area** - This is where the page content sits, which is smaller in size than the full container.

**3: Padding** - This area is padding, which is the space that gets subtracted from the full container.
